<h2><a name="NOTE" id="NOTE"></a>NOTE.</h2>


<p>In all important respects I leave this brief “Life of
Keats” to speak for itself. There is only one point
which I feel it needful to dwell upon. In the summer
of 1886 I was invited to undertake a life of Keats for
the present series, and I assented. Some while afterwards
it was publicly announced that a life of Keats, which had
been begun by Mr. Sidney Colvin long before for a
different series, would be published at an early date. I
read up my materials, began in March 1887 the writing
of my book, finished it on June 3rd, and handed it over
to the editor. On June 10th Mr. Colvin’s volume was
published. I at once read it, and formed a high opinion
of its merits, and I found in it some new details which
could not properly be ignored by any succeeding biographer
of the poet. I therefore got my MS. back, and
inserted here and there such items of fresh information
as were really needful for the true presentment of my
subject-matter. In justice both to Mr. Colvin and to
myself I drew upon his pages for only a minimum, not a
maximum, of the facts which they embody; and in all
matters of opinion and criticism I left my MS. exactly as
it stood. The reader will thus understand that the
present “Life of Keats” is, in planning, structure, execution,
and estimate, entirely independent of Mr. Colvin’s;
but that I have ultimately had the advantage of consulting
Mr. Colvin’s book as one of my various sources of
information&mdash;the latest and within its own lines the completest
of all.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>A truism must do duty as my first sentence.
There are long lives, and there are eventful lives:
there are also short lives, and uneventful ones. Keats’s
life was both short and uneventful. To the differing
classes of lives different modes of treatment may properly
be applied by the biographer. In the case of a
writer whose life was both long and eventful, I might feel
disposed to carry the whole narrative forward <i>pari passu</i>,
and to exhibit in one panorama the outward and the
inward career, the incidents and the product, the doings
and environment, and the writings, acting and re-acting
upon one another. In the instance of Keats this does
not appear to me to be the most fitting method. It may
be more appropriate to apportion his Life into two sections:
and to treat firstly of his general course from the
cradle to the grave, and secondly of his performances in
literature. The two things will necessarily overlap to
some extent, but I shall keep them apart so far as may
be convenient. When we have seen what he did and
what he wrote, we shall be prepared to enter upon some
analysis of his character and personality. This will form<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
my third section; and in a fourth I shall endeavour to
estimate the quality and value of his writings, in particular
and in general. Thus I address myself in the first
instance to a narrative of the outer facts of his life.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>John Keats came of undistinguished parentage. No
biographer carries his pedigree further than his maternal
grandfather, or alleges that there was any trace, however
faint or remote, of ancestral eminence. The maternal
grandfather was a Mr. Jennings, who kept a large livery-stable,
called the Swan and Hoop, in the Pavement,
Moorfields, London, opposite the entrance to Finsbury
Circus. The principal stableman or assistant in the business
was named Thomas Keats, of Devonshire or Cornish
parentage. He was a well-conducted, sensible, good-looking
little man, and won the favour of Jennings’s
daughter, named Frances or Fanny: they married, and
this rather considerable rise in his fortunes left Keats
unassuming and manly as before. He appears to have
been a natural gentleman. Jennings was a prosperous
tradesman, and might have died rich (his death took
place in 1805) but for easy-going good-nature tending to
the gullible. Mrs. Keats seems to have been in character
less uniform and single-minded than her husband.
She is described as passionately fond of amusement,
prodigal, dotingly attached to her children, more especially
John, much beloved by them in return, sensible, and at
the same time saturnine in demeanour: a personable tall
woman with a large oval face. Her pleasure-seeking
tendency probably led her into some imprudences, for
her first baby, John, was a seven months’ child.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>John Keats was born at the Moorfields place of business
on the 31st of October 1795. This date of birth
is established by the register of baptisms at St. Botolph’s,
Bishopsgate: the date usually assigned, the 29th of
October, appears to be inaccurate, though Keats himself,
and others of the family, believed in it. There were three
other children of the marriage&mdash;or four if we reckon a
a son who died in infancy: George, Thomas, and lastly
Fanny, born in March 1803. An anecdote is told of John
when in the fifth year of his age, purporting to show forth
the depth of his childish affection for his mother. It is
said that she then lay seriously ill; and John stood
sentinel at her chamber-door, holding an old sword which
he had picked up about the premises, and he remained
there for hours to prevent her being disturbed. One may
fear, however, that this anecdote has taken an ideal
colouring through the lens of a partial biographer. The
painter Benjamin Robert Haydon&mdash;who, as we shall see
in the sequel, was extremely well acquainted with John
Keats, and who heard the story from his brother Thomas&mdash;records
it thus: “He was, when an infant, a most
violent and ungovernable child. At five years of age or
thereabouts he once got hold of a naked sword, and,
shutting the door, swore nobody should go out. His
mother wanted to do so; but he threatened her so
furiously she began to cry, and was obliged to wait till
somebody, through the window, saw her position, and
came to her rescue.” It can scarcely be supposed that
there were two different occasions when the quinquennial
John Keats superintended his mother and her belongings
with a naked sword&mdash;once in ardent and self-oblivious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
affection, and once in petulant and froward excitement.</p>

<p>The parents would have liked to send John to Harrow
school: but, this being finally deemed too expensive, he
was placed in the Rev. John Clarke’s school at Enfield,
then in high repute, and his brothers followed him thither.
The Enfield schoolhouse was a fine red-brick building of
the early eighteenth century, said to have been erected
by a retired West India merchant; the materials “moulded
into designs decorating the front with garlands of flowers
and pomegranates, together with heads of cherubim over
two niches in the centre of the building.” This central
part of the façade was eventually purchased for the South
Kensington Museum, and figures there as a screen in the
structural division. The schoolroom was forty feet long;
the playground was a spacious courtyard between the
schoolroom and the house itself; a garden, a hundred
yards in length, stretched beyond the playground, succeeded
by a sweep of greensward, with a “lake” or well-sized
pond: there was also a two-acre field with a couple
of cows. In this commodious seat of sound learning,
well cared for and well instructed so far as his school
course extended, John Keats remained for some years.
He came under the particular observation of the headmaster’s
son, Mr. Charles Cowden Clarke, not very many
years his senior. He was born in 1787, fostered Keats’s
interest in literature, became himself an industrious writer
of some standing, and died in 1877. Keats at school did
not show any exceptional talent, but he was, according to
Mr. Cowden Clarke’s phrase, “a very orderly scholar,”
and got easily through his tasks. In the last eighteen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
months of his schooling he took a new lease of assiduity:
he read a vast deal, and would keep to his book even
during meals. For two or three successive half-years he
obtained the first prize for voluntary work; and was to
be found early and late attending to some translation
from the Latin or the French, to which he would, when
allowed his own way, sacrifice his recreation-time. He
was particularly fond of Lemprière’s “Classical Dictionary,”
Tooke’s “Pantheon,” and Spence’s “Polymetis”:
a line of reading presageful of his own afterwork in the
region of Greek mythology. Of the Grecian language,
however, he learned nothing: in Latin he proceeded as
far as the Æneid, and of his own accord translated much
of that epic in writing. Two of his favourite books were
“Robinson Crusoe” and Marmontel’s “Incas of Peru.”
He must also have made some acquaintance with Shakespeare,
as he told a younger schoolfellow that he thought
no one durst read “Macbeth” alone in the house at two
in the morning. Not indeed that these bookish leanings
formed the whole of his personality as a schoolboy. He
was noticeable for beauty of face and expression, active
and energetic, intensely pugnacious, and even quarrelsome.
He was very apt to get into a fight with boys
much bigger than himself. Nor was his younger
brother George exempted: John would fight fiercely with
George, and this (if we may trust George’s testimony)
was always owing to John’s own unmanageable temper.
The two brothers were none the less greatly attached,
both at school and afterwards. The youngest brother,
Thomas (always called Tom in family records), is reported
to have been as pugilistic as John; whereas George, when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
allowed his own way, was pacific, albeit resolute. The
ideal of all the three boys was a maternal uncle, a naval
officer of very stalwart presence, who had been in
Admiral Duncan’s ship in the famous action off Camperdown;
where he had distinguished himself not only by
signal gallantry, but by not getting shot, though his tall
form was a continual mark for hostile guns.</p>

<p>While still a schoolboy at Enfield, John Keats lost both
his parents. The father died on the 16th of April 1804, in
returning from a visit to the school: a detail which serves
to show us (for I do not find it otherwise affirmed) that
John could at the utmost have been only in the ninth
year of his age, possibly even younger, when his schooling
began. On leaving Enfield, the father dined at Southgate,
and, going late homewards, his horse fell in the City
Road, and the rider’s skull was fractured. He was found
about one o’clock in the morning speechless, and expired
towards eight, aged thirty-six. The mother suffered from
rheumatism, and later on from consumption; of which
she died in February 1810. “John,” so writes Haydon,
“sat up whole nights with her in a great chair, would
suffer nobody to give her medicine or even cook her food
but himself, and read novels to her in her intervals of ease.”
She had been an easily consoled widow, for, within a year
from the decease of her first husband, she married another,
William Rawlings, who had probably succeeded to
the management of the business. She soon, however,
separated from Rawlings, and lived with her mother at
Edmonton. After her death Keats hid himself for some
days in a nook under his master’s desk, passionately inconsolable.
The four children, who inherited from their
grandparents (chiefly from their grandmother) a moderate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
fortune of nearly £8,000 altogether, in which the daughter
had the largest share, were then left under the guardianship
of Mr. Abbey, a city merchant residing at Walthamstow.
At the age of fifteen, or at some date before the
close of 1810, John quitted his school.</p>

<p>A little stave of doggrel which Keats wrote to his
sister, probably in July 1818, gives a glimpse of what he
was like at the time when he and his brothers were living
with their grandmother.</p>

<p>He was fond of “goldfinches, tomtits, minnows, mice,
ticklebacks, dace, cock-salmons, and all the whole tribe of
the bushes and the brooks.”</p>

<p>A career in life was promptly marked out for the youth.
While still aged fifteen, he was apprenticed, with a premium
of £210, to Mr. Hammond, a surgeon of some
repute at Edmonton. Mr. Cowden Clarke says that this
arrangement evidently gave Keats satisfaction: apparently
he refers rather to the convenient vicinity of Edmonton
to Enfield than to the surgical profession itself. The
indenture was to have lasted five years; but, for some
reason which is not wholly apparent, Keats left Hammond
before the close of his apprenticeship.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> If Haydon was
rightly informed (presumably by Keats himself), the
reason was that the youth resented surgery as the antagonist
of a possible poetic vocation, and “at last his master,
weary of his disgust, gave him up his time.” He then
took to walking St. Thomas’s Hospital; and, after a short
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>stay at No. 8 Dean Street, Borough, and next in St.
Thomas’s Street, he resided along with his two brothers&mdash;who
were at the time clerks in Mr. Abbey’s office&mdash;in the
Poultry, Cheapside, over the passage which led to the
Queen’s Arms Tavern. Two of his surgical companions
were Mr. Henry Stephens, who afterwards introduced
creosote into medical practice, and Mr. George Wilson
Mackereth. Keats attended the usual lectures, and made
careful annotations in a book still preserved. Mr.
Stephens relates that Keats was fond of scribbling rhyme
of a sort among professional notes, especially those of a
fellow-student, and he sometimes showed graver verses to
his associates. Finally, in July 1815, he passed the examination
at Apothecaries’ Hall with considerable credit&mdash;more
than his familiars had counted upon; and in
March 1816 he was appointed a dresser at Guy’s under
Mr. Lucas. Cowden Clarke once inquired how far
Keats liked his studies at the hospital. The youth replied
that he did not relish anatomy: “The other day,
for instance, during the lecture, there came a sunbeam
into the room, and with it a whole troop of creatures
floating in the ray, and I was off with them to Oberon
and fairyland.”</p>

<p>Readers of Keats’s poetry will have no difficulty in
believing that, ever since his first introduction into a
professional life, surgery and literature had claimed a
divided allegiance from him. When at Edmonton
with Mr. Hammond, he kept up his connection with
the Clarke family, especially with Charles Cowden
Clarke. He was perpetually borrowing books; and at
last, about the beginning of 1812 he asked for Spenser’s<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
“Faery Queen,” rather to the surprise of the family, who
had no idea that that particular book could be at all
in his line. The effect, however, was very noticeable.
Keats walked to Enfield at least once a week, for the
purpose of talking over Spenser with Cowden Clarke.
“He ramped through the scenes of the romance,” said
Clarke, “like a young horse turned into a spring
meadow.” A fine touch of description or of imagery, or
energetic epithets such as “the sea-shouldering whale,”
would light up his face with ecstasy. His leisure had
already been given to reading and translation, including
the completion of his rendering of the Æneid. A
literary craving was now at fever-heat, and he took to
writing verses as well as reading them. Soon surgery
and letters were to conflict no longer&mdash;the latter obtaining,
contrary to the liking of Mr. Abbey, the absolute
and permanent mastery. Keats indeed always denied
that he abandoned surgery for the express purpose of
taking to poetry: he alleged that his motive had been
the dread of doing some mischief in his surgical operations.
His last operation consisted in opening a
temporal artery; he was entirely successful in it, but the
success appeared to himself like a miracle, the recurrence
of which was not to be reckoned on.</p>

<p>While surgery was waning with Keats, and finally
dying out&mdash;an upshot for which the exact date is not
assigned, nor perhaps assignable&mdash;he was making, at first
through his intimacy with Cowden Clarke, some good
literary acquaintances. The brothers John and Leigh
Hunt were the centre of the circle to which Keats was
thus admitted. John was the publisher, and Leigh the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
editor, of <i>The Examiner</i>. They had both been lately
fined, and imprisoned for two years, for a libel on the
Prince Regent, George IV.; it was perhaps legally a
libel, and was certainly a castigation laid on with no
indulgent hand. Leigh Hunt (born in 1784, and therefore
Keats’s senior by some eleven years) is known to us
all as a fresh and airy essayist, a fresh and airy poet, a
liberal thinker in the morals both of society and of
politics (hardly a politician in the stricter sense of the
term), a charming companion, a too-constant cracker of
genial jocosities and of puns. He understood good
literature both instinctively and critically; but was too
full of tricksy mannerisms, and of petted byways in thought
and style, to be an altogether safe associate for a youthful
literary aspirant, whether as model or as Mentor. Leigh
Hunt first saw Keats in the spring of 1816, not at his
residence in Hampstead as has generally been supposed,
but at No. 8 York Buildings, New Road.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> The earliest
meeting of Keats with Haydon was in November 1816,
at Hunt’s house; Haydon born in 1786, the zealous and
impatient champion of high art, wide-minded and combative,
too much absorbed in his love for art to be without
a considerable measure of self-seeking for art’s
apostle, himself. He painted into his large picture of
Christ’s Entry into Jerusalem the head of Keats, along
with those of Wordsworth and others. Another acquaintance
was Mr. Charles Ollier, the publisher, who wrote
verse and prose of his own. The Ollier firm in the early
spring of 1817 became the publishers of Keats’s first
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>volume of poems, of which more anon. Still earlier
than the Hunts, Haydon, and Ollier, Keats had known
John Hamilton Reynolds, his junior by a year, a poetical
writer of some mark, now too nearly forgotten, author of
“The Garden of Florence,” “The Fancy,” and the prose
tale, “Miserrimus”; he was the son of the writing-master
at Christ Hospital, and Keats became intimate with the
whole family, though not invariably well pleased with
them all. One of the sisters married Thomas Hood.
Through Reynolds Keats made acquaintance with Mr.
Benjamin Bailey, born towards 1794, then a student at
Oxford reading for the Church, afterwards Archdeacon
of Colombo in Ceylon. Charles Wentworth Dilke, born
in 1789, the critic, and eventually editor of <i>The Athenæum</i>,
was another intimate; and in course of time Keats knew
Charles Wells, seven years younger than himself, the
author of the dramatic poem “Joseph and his Brethren,”
and of the prose “Stories after Nature.” Other friends
will receive mention as we progress. I have for the
present said enough to indicate what was the particular
niche in the mansion of English literary life in which
Keats found himself housed at the opening of his career.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II.</h2>


<p>We have now reached the year 1817 and the month
of May, when Keats was in the twenty-second
year of his age. He then wrote that he had “forgotten
all surgery,” and was beginning at Margate his romantic
epic of “Endymion,” reading and writing about eight
hours a day. Keats had previously been at Carisbrooke
in the Isle of Wight, but had run away from there, finding
that the locality, while it charmed, also depressed him.
He had left London for the island, apparently with the
view of having greater leisure for study and composition.
His brother Tom was with him at Carisbrooke and at
Margate. He was already provided with a firm of publishers,
Messrs. Taylor and Hessey, willing to undertake
the risk of “Endymion,” and they advanced him a sum
sufficient for continuing at work on it with comfort. In
September he went with Mr. Benjamin Bailey to Oxford:
they made an excursion to Stratford-on-Avon, and Keats
was back at Hampstead by the end of the month. It
would appear that in Oxford Keats, in the heat of youthful
blood, committed an indiscretion of which we do not
know the details, nor need we give them if we knew
them; for on the 8th of October he wrote to Bailey in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
these terms: “The little mercury I have taken has corrected
the poison and improved my health,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> though I
feel, from my employment, that I shall never again be
secure in robustness.” The residence of Keats and his
brother Tom in Hampstead, a first-floor lodging, was in
Well Walk, No. 1, next to the Wells Tavern, which was
then called the Green Man. The reader who has a head
for localities should bear this point well in mind, should
carefully discriminate the house in Well Walk from
another house, Wentworth Place, afterwards tenanted by
Keats and others at Hampstead, and, every time that the
question occurs to his thought, should pass a mental vote
of thanks to Mr. Buxton Forman for the great pains
which he took to settle the point, and the lucid and
pleasant account which he has given of it. Keats was at
Leatherhead in November; finished the first draft of
“Endymion” at Burford Bridge, near Dorking, on the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>28th of that month, and returned to Hampstead for the
winter. Two anecdotes which have often been repeated
belong apparently to about this date. One of them
purports that Keats gave a sound drubbing in Hampstead
to a butcher, or a butcher’s boy, who was ill-treating a
small boy, or else a cat. Hunt simply says that the
butcher “had been insolent,”&mdash;by implication, to Keats
himself. The “butcher’s boy” has obtained traditional
currency; but, according to George Keats, the offender
was “a scoundrel in livery,” the locality “a blind alley
at Hampstead.” Clarke says that the stand-up fight
lasted nearly an hour. Keats was an undersized man,
in fact he was not far removed from the dwarfish, being
barely more than five feet high, and this small feat of
stubborn gallantry deserves to be appraised and praised
accordingly. The other anecdote is that Coleridge met
Keats along with Leigh Hunt in a lane near Highgate,
“a loose, slack, not well-dressed youth,” and after shaking
hands with Keats, he said aside to Hunt, “There is
death in that hand.” Nothing is extant to show that at
so early a date as this, or even for some considerable
while after, any of Keats’s immediate friends shared the
ominous prevision of Coleridge.</p>

<p>In March 1818 Keats joined his brothers at Teignmouth
in Devonshire, and in April “Endymion” was
published. In June he set off on a pedestrian tour of
some extent with a friend whose name will frequently
recur from this point forwards, Charles Armitage Brown.
One is generally inclined to get some idea of what a man
was like; if one knows what he was <i>un</i>like much the
same purpose is served. In April 1819 Keats wrote<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
some bantering verses about Brown, which are understood
to go mainly by contraries we therefore infer
Brown to have presented a physical and moral aspect
the reverse of the following&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p>Mr. Brown, son of a London stockbroker from Scotland,
was a man several years older than Keats, born in 1786.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
He was a Russia merchant retired from business, of
much culture and instinctive sympathy with genius, and
he enjoyed assisting the efforts of young men of promise.
He had produced the libretto of an opera, “Narensky,”
and he eventually published a book on the Sonnets of
Shakespeare. From the date we have now reached, the
summer of 1818, which was more than a year following
their first introduction, Brown may be regarded as the
most intimate of all Keats’s friends, Dilke coming next
to him.</p>

<p>The pedestrian tour with Brown was the sequel of a
family leave-taking at Liverpool. George Keats, finding
in himself no vocation for trade, with its smug compliances
and sleek assiduities (and John agreed with him
in these views), had determined to emigrate to America,
and rough it in a new settlement for a living, perhaps for
fortune; and, as a preliminary step, he had married Miss
Georgiana Augusta Wylie, a girl of sixteen, daughter of a
deceased naval officer. The sonnet “Nymph of the
downward smile” &amp;c. was addressed to her. John
Keats and Brown, therefore, accompanied George and
his bride to Liverpool, and saw them off. They then
started as pedestrians into the Lake country, the land of
Burns, Belfast, and the Western Highlands. Before
starting on the trip Keats had often been in such a state
of health as to make it prudent that he should not hazard
exposure to night air; but in his excursion he seems to
have acted like a man of sound and rather hardy physique,
walking from day to day about twenty miles, and sometimes
more, and his various records of the trip have
nothing of a morbid or invaliding tone. This was not,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
however, to last long; the Isle of Mull proved too much
for him. On the 23rd of July, writing to his brother
Tom, he describes the expedition thus: “The road
through the island, or rather track, is the most dreary
you can think of; between dreary mountains, over bog
and rock and river, with our breeches tucked up and our
stockings in hand.... We had a most wretched walk of
thirty-seven miles across the island of Mull, and then we
crossed to Iona.” In another letter he says: “Walked
up to my knees in bog; got a sore throat; gone to see
Icolmkill and Staffa.” From this time forward the mention
of the sore throat occurs again and again; sometimes
it is subsiding, or as good as gone; at other times it has
returned, and causes more or less inconvenience. Brown
wrote of it as “a violent cold and ulcerated throat.” The
latest reference to it comes in December 1819, only two
months preceding the final and alarming break-down in
the young poet’s health. In Scotland, at any rate, amid
the exposure and exertion of the walking tour, the sore
throat was not to be staved off; so, having got as far as
Inverness, Keats, under medical advice, reluctantly cut
his journey short, parted from Brown, and went on board
the smack from Cromarty. A nine days’ passage brought
him to London Bridge, and on the 18th of August he
presented himself to the rather dismayed eyes of Mrs.
Dilke. “John Keats,” she wrote, “arrived here last
night, as brown and as shabby as you can imagine:
scarcely any shoes left, his jacket all torn at the back, a
fur cap, a great plaid, and his knapsack. I cannot tell
what he looked like.” More ought to be said here of
the details of Keats’s Scottish and Irish trip; but such<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
details, not being of essential importance as incidents in
his life, could only be given satisfactorily in the form of
copious extracts from his letters, and for these&mdash;readable
and picturesque as they are&mdash;I have not adequate space.
He preferred, on the whole, the Scotch people to the
little which he saw of the Irish. Just as Keats was
leaving Scotland, because of his own ailments, he had
been summoned away thence on account of the more
visibly grave malady of his brother Tom, who was in an
advanced stage of consumption; but it appears that the
letter did not reach his hands at the time.</p>

<p>The next three months were passed by Keats along
with Tom at their Hampstead lodgings. Anxiety and
affection&mdash;warm affection, deep anxiety&mdash;were of no avail.
Tom died at the beginning of December, aged just
twenty, and was buried on the 7th of that month. The
words in “King Lear,” “Poor Tom,” remain underlined
by the surviving brother.</p>

<p>John Keats was now solitary in the world. Tom was
dead, George and his bride in America, Fanny, his girlish
sister, a permanent inmate of the household of Mr. and
Mrs. Abbey at Walthamstow. In December he quitted
his lodgings at Hampstead, and set up house along with
Mr. Brown in what was then called Wentworth Place,
Hampstead, now Lawn Bank; Brown being rightly the
tenant, and Keats a paying resident with Brown. Wentworth
Place consisted of only two houses. One of them
was thus inhabited by Brown and Keats, the other by the
Dilkes. In the first of these houses, when Brown and
Keats were away, and afterwards in the second, there
was also a well-to-do family of the name of Brawne,&mdash;a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
mother, with a son and two daughters. Lawn Bank is
the penultimate house on the right of John Street, next
to Wentworth House: Dr. Sharpey passed some of his
later years in it. This is, beyond all others, the dwelling
which remains permanently linked with the memory of
Keats.</p>

<p>While Tom was still lingering out the days of his brief
life, Keats made the acquaintance of two young ladies.
He has left us a description of both of them. His portraiture
of the first, Miss Jane Cox, is written in a tone
which might seem the preliminary to a <i>grande passion</i>;
but this did not prove so; she rapidly passed out of his
existence and out of his memory. His portraiture of the
second, Miss Fanny Brawne, does not suggest anything
beyond a tepid liking which might perhaps merge into
a definite antipathy; this also was delusive, for he was
from the first smitten with Miss Brawne, and soon
profoundly in love with her&mdash;I might say desperately in
love, for indeed desperation, which became despair, was
the main ingredient in his passion, in all but its earliest
stages. I shall here extract these two passages, for both
of them are of exceptional importance for our biography&mdash;one
as acquainting us with Keats’s general range of feeling
in relation to women, and the other as introducing the
most serious and absorbing sentiment of the last two
years of his life. On October 29, 1818, he wrote as
follows to his brother George and his wife in America:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“The Misses Reynolds are very kind to me.... On
my return, the first day I called [this was probably towards
the 20th of September], they were in a sort of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
taking or bustle about a cousin of theirs, Miss Cox, who,
having fallen out with her grandpapa in a serious manner,
was invited by Mrs. Reynolds to take asylum in her
house. She is an East Indian, and ought to be her
grandfather’s heir.... From what I hear she is not
without faults of a real kind; but she has others which
are more apt to make women of inferior claims hate her.
She is not a Cleopatra, but is at least a Charmian; she
has a rich Eastern look; she has fine eyes and fine
manners. When she comes into the room she makes the
same impression as the beauty of a leopardess. She is
too fine and too conscious of herself to repulse any man
who may address her; from habit she thinks that nothing
particular. I always find myself more at ease with such
a woman; the picture before me always gives me a life
and animation which I cannot possibly feel with anything
inferior. I am at such times too much occupied in
admiring to be awkward or in a tremble; I forget myself
entirely, because I live in her. You will by this time
think I am in love with her; so, before I go any further,
I will tell you I am not. She kept me awake one night,
as a tune of Mozart’s might do. I speak of the thing as a
pastime and an amusement, than which I can feel none
deeper than a conversation with an imperial woman, the
very yes and no of whose lips<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> is to me a banquet. I
don’t cry to take the moon home with me in my pocket,
nor do I fret to leave her behind me. I like her, and
her like, because one has no <i>sensations</i>; what we both
are is taken for granted. You will suppose I have by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
this time had much talk with her. No such thing; there
are the Misses Reynolds on the look out. They think I
don’t admire her because I don’t stare at her; they call
her a flirt to me&mdash;what a want of knowledge! She walks
across a room in such a manner that a man is drawn to
her with a magnetic power; this they call flirting! They
do not know things; they do not know what a woman is.
I believe, though, she has faults, the same as Charmian
and Cleopatra might have had. Yet she is a fine thing,
speaking in a worldly way; for there are two distinct
tempers of mind in which we judge of things:&mdash;the worldly,
theatrical, and pantomimical; and the unearthly, spiritual,
and ethereal. In the former, Bonaparte, Lord Byron,
and this Charmian, hold the first place in our mind; in
the latter, John Howard, Bishop Hooker rocking his
child’s cradle, and you, my dear sister, are the conquering
feelings. As a man of the world, I love the rich talk
of a Charmian; as an eternal being, I love the thought of
you. I should like her to ruin me, and I should like
you to save me.”</p></div>

<p>So much for Miss Cox, the Charmian whom Keats was
not in love with. This is not absolutely the sole mention
of her in his letters, but it is the only one of importance.
We now turn to Miss Brawne, the young lady with whom
he had fallen very much in love at a date even preceding
that to which the present description must belong. The
description comes from a letter to George and Georgiana
Keats, written probably towards the middle of December
1818. It is true that the name Brawne does not appear
in the printed version of the letter, but the “very positive<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
conviction” expressed by Mr. Forman that that name
really does stand in the MS., a conviction “shared by
members of her family,” may safely be adopted by all
my readers. I therefore insert the name where a blank
had heretofore appeared in print.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Perhaps, as you are fond of giving me sketches of
characters, you may like a little picnic of scandal, even
across the Atlantic. Shall I give you Miss Brawne? She
is about my height, with a fine style of countenance of
the lengthened sort. She wants sentiment in every
feature. She manages to make her hair look well; her
nostrils are very fine, though a little painful; her mouth
is bad, and good; her profile is better than her full face,
which indeed is not ‘full,’ but pale and thin, without
showing any bone; her shape is very graceful, and so are
her movements; her arms are good, her hands bad-ish,
her feet tolerable. She is not seventeen [Keats, if he
really wrote ‘not seventeen,’ was wrong here; ‘not nineteen’
would have been correct, as she was born on
August 9, 1800.] But she is ignorant, monstrous in her
behaviour, flying out in all directions; calling people such
names that I was forced lately to make use of the term
‘minx.’ This is, I think, from no innate vice, but from
a penchant she has for acting stylishly. I am, however,
tired of such style, and shall decline any more of it.
She had a friend to visit her lately. You have known
plenty such. She plays the music, but without one
sensation but the feel of the ivory at her fingers. She is
a downright Miss, without one set-off. We hated her
[“We” would apparently be Keats, Brown, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
Dilkes], and smoked her, and baited her, and I think
drove her away. Miss Brawne thinks her a paragon of
fashion, and says she is the only woman in the world she
would change persons with. What a stupe! She is as
superior as a rose to a dandelion.”</p></div>

<p>At the time when Keats wrote these words he had
known Miss Brawne for a couple of months, more or
less, having first seen her in October or November at the
house of the Dilkes. It might seem that he was about
this time in a state of feeling propense to love. <i>Some</i>
woman was required to fill the void in his heart. The
woman might have been Miss Cox, whom he met in
September. As the event turned out, it was not she, but
it <i>was</i> Miss Brawne, whom he met in October or
November. Fanny Brawne was the elder daughter of a
gentleman of independent means, who died while she
was still a child; he left another daughter and a son with
their mother; and the whole family, as already mentioned,
lived at times in the same house which the Dilkes
occupied in Wentworth-place, Hampstead, and at other
times in the adjoining house, while not tenanted by
Brown and Keats. Miss Brawne (I quote here from Mr.
Forman) “had much natural pride and buoyancy, and
was quite capable of affecting higher spirits and less
concern than she really felt. But, as to the genuineness
of her attachment to Keats, some of those who knew her
personally have no doubt whatever."<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> If so&mdash;or indeed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
whether so or not&mdash;it is a pity that she was wont, after
Keats’s death, to speak of him (as has been averred) as
“that foolish young poet who was in love with me.” That
Keats was a poet and a young poet is abundantly true;
but that he was a foolish one had even before his death,
and especially very soon after it, been found out to be a
gross delusion by a large number of people, and might
just as well have been found out by his betrothed bride
in addition. I know of only one portrait of Miss Brawne;
it is a silhouette by Edouart, engraved in two of Mr.
Forman’s publications. A silhouette is one of the least
indicative forms of portraiture for enabling one to judge
whether the sitter was handsome or not. This likeness
shows a very profuse mass of hair, a tall, rather sloping,
forehead, a long and prominent aquiline nose, a mouth
and chin of the <i>petite</i> kind, a very well-developed throat,
and a figure somewhat small in proportion to the head.
The face is not of the sort which I should suppose to
have ever been beautiful in an artist’s eyes, or in a poet’s
either; and indeed Keats’s description of Miss Brawne,
which I have just cited, is qualified, chilly, and critical,
with regard to beauty. Nevertheless, his love-letters to
Miss Brawne, most of which have been preserved and
published, speak of her beauty very emphatically. “The
very first week I knew you I wrote myself your vassal;”
“I cannot conceive any beginning of such love as I have
for you, but beauty;” “all I can bring you is a swooning<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
admiration of your beauty.” It seems probable that
Keats was the declared lover of Miss Brawne in April
1819 at the latest&mdash;more probably in February; and
when his first published letter to her was written, July
1819, he and she must certainly have been already
engaged, or all but engaged, to marry. This was contrary
to Mrs. Brawne’s liking. They appear to have contemplated&mdash;anything
but willingly on the poet’s part&mdash;a
tolerably long engagement; for he was a young man of
twenty-three, with stinted means, no regular profession,
and no occupation save that of producing verse derided
in the high places of criticism. He spoke indeed of
re-studying in Edinburgh for the medical profession:
this was a vague notion, with which no practical beginning
was made. An early marriage, followed by a year
or so of pleasuring and of intellectual advancement in
some such place as Rome or Zurich, was what Keats
really longed for.</p>

<p>We must now go back a little&mdash;to December 1818.
Haydon was then still engaged upon his picture of
Christ’s Entry into Jerusalem, and found his progress
impeded by want of funds, and by a bad attack, from
which he frequently suffered, of weakness of eyesight.
On the 22nd of the month, Keats, with conspicuous
generosity&mdash;and although he had already lent nearly
£200 to various friends&mdash;tendered him any money-aid
which might be in his power; asking merely that his
friend would claim the fulfilment of his promise only in
the last resort. On January 7, 1819, Haydon definitely
accepted his offer; and Keats wrote back, hoping to
comply, and refusing to take any interest. His own<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
money affairs were, however, at this time almost at a deadlock,
controlled by lawyers and by his ex-guardian Mr.
Abbey; and the amount which he had expected to
command as coming to him after his brother Tom’s
death was not available. He had to explain as much in
April 1819 to Haydon, who wrote with some urgency.
Eventually he did make a small loan to the painter&mdash;£30;
but very shortly afterwards (June 17th) was compelled
to ask for a reimbursement&mdash;“do borrow or beg somehow
what you can for me.” There was a chancery-suit of
old standing, begun soon after the death of Mr. Jennings in
1805, and it continued to obstruct Keats in his money
affairs. The precise facts of these were also but ill-known
to the poet, who had potentially at his disposal
certain funds which remained <i>perdu</i> and unused until
two years after his death. On September 20, 1819, he
wrote to his brother George in America that Haydon
had been unable to make the repayment; and he added,
“He did not seem to care much about it, and let me go
without my money with almost nonchalance, when he
ought to have sold his drawings to supply me. I shall
perhaps still be acquainted with him, but, for friendship,
that is at an end.” And in fact the hitherto very ardent
cordiality between the poet and the painter does seem to
have been materially damped after this date; Keats being
somewhat reserved towards Haydon, and Haydon finding
more to censure than to extol in the conduct of Keats.
We can feel with both of them; and, while we pronounce
Keats blameless and even praiseworthy throughout, may
infer Haydon to have been not greatly blameable.</p>

<p>Towards the end of June 1819 Keats went to Shank<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>lin;
his first companion there being an invalid but witty
and cheerful friend, James Rice, a solicitor, and his
second, Brown, who co-operated at this time with the
poet in producing the drama “Otho the Great.” Next,
the two friends went to Winchester, “chiefly,” wrote
Keats to his sister Fanny, “for the purpose of being near
a tolerable library, which after all is not to be found in
this place. However, we like it very much; it is the
pleasantest town I ever was in, and has the most recommendations
of any.” One of his letters from here
(September 21) speaks of his being now almost as well
acquainted with Italian as with French, and he adds, “I
shall set myself to get complete in Latin, and there my
learning must stop. I do not think of venturing upon
Greek.” It is stated that he learned Italian with uncommon
quickness.</p>

<p>Early in the winter which closed 1819 George Keats
came over for a short while from America, his main
object being to receive his share of the money accruing
from the decease of his brother Tom, to the cost of
whose illness he had largely contributed. He had been
in Cincinnati, and had engaged in business, but as yet
without any success. In some lines which John Keats
addressed to Miss Brawne in October there is an energetic
and no doubt consciously overloaded denunciation of
“that most hateful land, dungeoner of my friends, that
monstrous region,” &amp;c., &amp;c. John, it appears, concealed
from George, during his English visit, the fact
that he himself was then much embarrassed in money-matters,
and almost wholly dependent upon his friends
for a subsistence meanwhile; and George left England<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
again without doing anything for his brother’s relief or
convenience. He took with him £700, some substantial
part of which appears to have been the property of John,
absolutely or contingently; and he undertook to remit
shortly to his brother £200, to be raised by the sale of a
boat which he owned in America; but months passed,
and the £200 never came, no purchaser for the boat
being procurable. Out of the £1,100 which Tom Keats
had left, George received £440, John hardly more than
£200, George thus repaying himself some money which
had been previously advanced for John’s professional
education. For all this he has been very severely
censured, Mr. Brown being among his sternest and most
persistent assailants. It must seemingly have been to
George Keats, and yet not to him exclusively, that
Colonel Finch referred in the letter which reached
Shelley’s eyes, saying that John had been “infamously
treated by the very persons whom his generosity had
rescued from want and woe;” and Shelley re-enforced
this accusation in his preface to “Adonais”&mdash;“hooted
from the stage of life, no less by those on whom he had
wasted the promise of his genius than those on whom he
had lavished his fortune and his care.” From these painful
charges George Keats eventually vindicated himself with
warmth of feeling, and with so much solidity of demonstration
as availed to convince Mr. Dilke, and also Mr.
Abbey. Who were the other offenders glanced at by
Colonel Finch, as also in one of Severn’s letters, I have
no distinct idea.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III.</h2>


<p>From this point forwards nothing but misery remains
to be recorded of John Keats. The narrative
becomes depressing to write and depressing to read.
The sensation is like that of being confined in a dark
vault at noonday. One knows, indeed, that the sun of
the poet’s genius is blazing outside, and that, on emerging
from the vault, we shall be restored to light and warmth;
but the atmosphere within is not the less dark and
laden, nor the shades the less murky. In tedious wretchedness,
racked and dogged with the pang of body and
soul, exasperated and protesting, raging now, and now
ground down into patience and acceptance, Keats gropes
through the valley of the shadow of death.</p>

<p>Before detailing the facts, we must glance for a minute
at the position. Keats had a passionate ambition and a
passionate love&mdash;the ambition to be a poet, the love of
Fanny Brawne. At the beginning of 1820, he was
conscious of his authentic vocation as a poet, and conscious
also that this vocation, though recognized in a
small and to some extent an influential circle, was
publicly denied and ridiculed; his portion was the hiss<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
of the viper and the gander, the hooting of the impostor
and the owl. His forthcoming volume was certain to
share the same fate; he knew its claims would be perversely
resisted and cruelly repudiated. If he could
make no serious impression as a poet, not only was his
leading ambition thwarted, but he would also be impeded
in getting any other and more paying literary work to
do&mdash;regular profession or employment he had none.
He was at best a poor man, and, for the while, almost
bereft of any command of funds. So long as this state of
things, or anything like it, continued, he would be unable
to marry the woman of his heart. While sickness kept
him a prisoner, he was torn by ideas of her volatility and
fickleness. Disease was sapping his vitals, pain wrung
him, Death beckoned him with finger more and more
imperative. Poetic fame became the vision of Tantalus,
and love the clasp of Ixion.</p>

<p>Such was the life, or such the incipient death, of
Keats, in the last twelvemonth of his brief existence.</p>

<p>For half a year prior to February 1820 he had been
unrestful and cheerless. “Either that gloom overspread
me,” so he wrote to James Rice, “or I was suffering under
some passionate feeling, or, if I turned to versify, that exacerbated
the poison of either sensation.” He began taking
laudanum at times, but was induced by Brown, towards
the end of 1819, to promise to give up this insidious
practice. Then came the crash: it was at Hampstead, on
the night of the 3rd of February.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“One night, about eleven o’clock,” I quote the words
of Lord Houghton, which have become classical, “Keats<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
returned home<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> in a state of strange physical excitement;
it might have appeared, to those who did not know him,
one of fierce intoxication. He told his friend [Brown]
he had been outside the stage-coach, had received a
severe chill, was a little fevered; but added: ‘I don’t
feel it now.’ He was easily persuaded to go to bed;
and, as he leapt into the cold sheets, before his head was
on the pillow, he slightly coughed, and said: ‘That is
blood from my mouth. Bring me the candle: let me
see this blood.’ He gazed steadfastly some moments at
the ruddy stain, and then, looking in his friend’s face
with an expression of sudden calmness never to be
forgotten, said: ‘I know the colour of that blood&mdash;it is
arterial blood. I cannot be deceived in that colour.
That drop is my death-warrant; I must die.’”</p></div>

<p>A surgeon arrived shortly, bled Keats, and pronounced
the rupture to be unimportant, but the patient was not
satisfied. He wrote to Miss Brawne some few days
afterwards, “So violent a rush of blood came to my
lungs that I felt nearly suffocated.” By the 6th of the
month, however, he was already better, and he then said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
in a letter to his sister: “From imprudently leaving off
my great-coat in the thaw, I caught cold, which flew to
my lungs.” Later on he suffered from palpitation of the
heart; but was so far recovered by the 25th of March
as to be able to go to town to the exhibition of Haydon’s
picture, Christ’s Entry into Jerusalem, and early in April
he could take a walk of five miles. In March he had
written that he was then picking up flesh, and, if he
could avoid inflammation for six weeks, might yet do
well; in April his doctor assured him that his only
malady was nervous irritability and general weakness,
caused by anxiety and by the excitement of poetry. At
an untoward time for his health, about the first week in
May, Keats was obliged to quit his residence in Hampstead;
as Brown was then leaving for Scotland, and,
according to his wont, let the house. Keats accordingly
went to live in Wesleyan Place, Kentish Town. A letter
which he wrote just before his departure speaks of his
uncertain outlook; he might be off to South America,
or, more likely, embarking as surgeon on a vessel trading
to the East Indies. This latter idea had been in his mind
for about a year past, off and on. What he could have contemplated
doing in South America is by no means
apparent. On the 7th of May Keats parted at Gravesend
from Brown, and they never met again. The hand with
which he grasped Brown’s, and which he had of old
“clenched against Hammond’s,” was now, according to
his own words, “that of a man of fifty.”</p>

<p>Things had thus gone on pretty well with Keats’s
health, since he first began to rally from the blood-spitting
attack of the 3rd of February; but this was not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
to continue. On the 22nd of June he again broke a
blood-vessel, and vomited blood morning and evening.
Leigh Hunt thought it high time to intervene, and
removed the patient to his house, No. 13 Mortimer
Terrace, Kentish Town. By the 7th of July&mdash;just about
the time when Keats’s last volume was published, the
one containing “Lamia,” “Hyperion,” and all his best
works&mdash;the physician had told him that he must not
remain in England, but go to Italy. On the 12th, Mrs.
Gisborne, the friend of Godwin and of Shelley, saw him
at Hunt’s house, looking emaciated, and “under sentence
of death from Dr. Lamb.” Three days afterwards
he wrote to Haydon “I am afraid I shall pop off just
when my mind is able to run alone.” The stay at Leigh
Hunt’s house came to an end in a way which speaks
volumes for the shattered nerves, and consequent morbid
susceptibility, of Keats. On the 10th of August a note
for him written by Miss Brawne, which “contained not
a word of the least consequence,” arrived at the house.
Keats was then resting in his own room, and Mrs. Hunt,
who was occupied, desired a female servant to give it to
him. The servant quitted the household on the following
day; and, in leaving, she handed the letter to Thornton
Hunt, then a mere child, asking him to reconsign it to
his mother. When Thornton did this on the 12th, the
letter was open; opened (one assumes) either by the
servant through idle curiosity, or by Thornton through
simple childishness. “Poor Keats was affected by this
inconceivable circumstance beyond what can be imagined.
He wept for several hours, and resolved, notwithstanding
Hunt’s entreaties, to leave the house. He went to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
Hampstead that same evening.” In Hampstead he had
at least the solace of being received into the dwelling
occupied by the Brawne family, being the same dwelling
(next door to that of Brown and Keats) which had been
recently tenanted by the Dilkes; yet the excitement of
feeling, consequent on the continual presence of Miss
Brawne, was perhaps harmful to him. Here he remained
until the time for journeying to Italy arrived. He was
still, it seems, left in some uncertainty as to the precise
nature and gravity of his disease, for on the 14th of
August he wrote to his sister: “’Tis not yet consumption,
I believe; but it would be, were I to remain in this
climate all the winter.” Anyhow, his expectations of
recovery, or of marked benefit from the Italian sojourn,
were but faint.</p>

<p>Something may here be said of the love-letters of
Keats to Fanny Brawne. They begin (as already stated)
on the 1st of July 1819, and end at some date between
his leaving Hampstead, early in May 1820, and quitting
Hunt’s house in August. We may assume the 10th July
1820, or thereabouts, as the date of the last letter. I cannot
say that the character of Keats gains to my eyes from the
perusal of this correspondence. Love-letters are not
expected to be models of self-regulation and “the philosophic
mind”; they would be bad love-letters, or letters
of a bad specimen of a lover, if they were so. Still, one
wants a man to show himself, <i>quâ</i> lover, at his highest in
letters of this stamp; one wants to find in them his
noblest self, his steadiest as his most ardent aspirations,
in one direction. Keats seems to me, throughout his
love-letters, unbalanced, wayward, and profuse; he ex<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>hibits
great fervour of temperament, and abundant
caressingness, without the inner depth of tenderness
and regard. He lives in his mistress, for himself. As
the letters pass further and further into the harsh black
shadows of disease, he abandons all self-restraint, and
lashes out right and left; he wills that his friends should
have been disloyal to him, as the motive for his being
disloyal to them. To make allowance for all this is
possible, and even necessary; but to treat it as not needing
that any allowance should be made would seem to
me futile. In the earlier letters of the series we have to
note a few points of biographic interest. He says that
he believes Miss Brawne liked him for himself, not for
his writings, and he loves her the more for it; that, on
first falling in love with her, he had written to declare
himself, but he burned the letter, fancying that she had
shown some dislike to him; that he had all his life been
indifferent to money matters, but must be chary of the
resources of his friends; that he was afraid of her “being
a little inclined to the Cressid”&mdash;one of the various
passages which show that he chafed at her girlish liking
for general society and diversions. On the 10th of
October 1819 he had had “a thousand kisses” from
her, and was resolved not to dispense with the thousand
and first. Early in June 1820 he speaks of her having
“been in the habit of flirting with Brown,” who “did not
know he was doing me to death by inches.”&mdash;It may be
well to give three of the letters as specimens:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

any degree of content. I must write you a line or two,
and see if that will assist in dismissing you from my mind
for ever so short a time. Upon my soul I can think of
nothing else. The time is past when I had power to
advise and warn you against the unpromising morning of
my life. My love has made me selfish. I cannot exist
without you; I am forgetful of everything but seeing you
again; my life seems to stop there&mdash;I see no further.
You have absorbed me; I have a sensation at the

rather be writing to you this morning, notwithstanding
the alloy of grief in such an occupation, than enjoy any
other pleasure, with health to boot, unconnected with you.
Upon my soul I have loved you to the extreme. I wish
you could know the tenderness with which I continually
brood over your different aspects of countenance, action,
and dress. I see you come down in the morning; I see
you meet me at the window; I see everything over again
eternally that I ever have seen. If I get on the pleasant

I am the theme, I will not be the friend of idle gossips.
Good gods, what a shame it is our loves should be so put

make you the saint of his memory. These laughers,

wish to live with you for ever. Do not let my name ever

merit than the great love for you, that were sufficient to
keep me sacred and unmentioned in such society. If I
have been cruel and unjust, I swear my love has ever
been greater than my cruelty&mdash;which lasts but a minute,
whereas my love, come what will, shall last for ever. If

heart and soul, and I could die more happily than I could
otherwise live. If you think me cruel, if you think I
have slighted you, do muse it over again, and see into
my heart. My love to you is ‘true as truth’s simplicity,
and simpler than the infancy of truth’&mdash;as I think I once
said before. How could I slight you? how threaten to
leave you? Not in the spirit of a threat to you&mdash;no, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
in the spirit of wretchedness in myself. My fairest, my
delicious, my angel Fanny, do not believe me such a
vulgar fellow. I will be as patient in illness and as
believing in love as I am able.”</p></div>


<div class="blockquot1"><p class="center">(III.)</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>(This is the last letter of the series. Its date is uncertain;
but may, as already intimated, be towards
July 10, 1820. It follows next after our No. 2.)</p></div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dearest Girl</span>,&mdash;I wish you could invent some
means to make me at all happy without you. Every
hour I am more and more concentrated in you; everything
else tastes like chaff in my mouth. I feel it almost
impossible to go to Italy. The fact is, I cannot leave
you, and shall never taste one minute’s content until it
pleases chance to let me live with you for good. But I
will not go on at this rate. A person in health, as you
are, can have no conception of the horrors that nerves
and a temper like mine go through.</p>

<p>“What island do your friends propose retiring to? I
should be happy to go with you there alone, but in
company I should object to it: the backbitings and
jealousies of new colonists, who have nothing else to
amuse themselves, is unbearable. Mr. Dilke came to
see me yesterday, and gave me a very great deal more
pain than pleasure. I shall never be able any more to
endure the society of any of those who used to meet at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
Elm Cottage<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> and Wentworth Place. The last two years
taste like brass upon my palate. If I cannot live with
you, I will live alone.</p>

<p>“I do not think my health will improve much while I
am separated from you. For all this, I am averse to
seeing you: I cannot bear flashes of light, and return into
my glooms again. I am not so unhappy now as I should
be if I had seen you yesterday. To be happy with you
seems such an impossibility: it requires a luckier star
than mine&mdash;it will never be.</p>

<p>“I enclose a passage from one of your letters which I
want you to alter a little: I want (if you will have it so)
the matter expressed less coldly to me.</p>

<p>“If my health would bear it, I could write a poem
which I have in my head, which would be a consolation
for people in such a situation as mine. I would show
some one in love, as I am, with a person living in such
liberty as you do.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Shakespeare always sums up matters
in the most sovereign manner. Hamlet’s heart was full of
such misery as mine is, when he said to Ophelia, ‘Go to a
nunnery, go, go!’ Indeed, I should like to give up the
matter at once&mdash;I should like to die. I am sickened at
the brute world you are smiling with. I hate men, and
women more. I see nothing but thorns for the future:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
wherever I may be next winter, in Italy or nowhere, Brown
will be living near you, with his indecencies. I see no
prospect of any rest. Suppose me in Rome. Well, I
should there see you, as in a magic glass, going to and from
town at all hours&mdash;I wish I could infuse a little confidence
of human nature into my heart: I cannot muster
any. The world is too brutal for me. I am glad there
is such a thing as the grave&mdash;I am sure I shall never
have any rest till I get there. At any rate, I will indulge
myself by never seeing any more Dilke or Brown or any
of their friends. I wish I was either in your arms full of
faith, or that a thunderbolt would strike me.&mdash;God bless
you.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“J. K.”</p>
</div>

<p>It is seldom one reads a letter (not to speak of a love-letter)
more steeped than this in wretchedness and acrimony;
wretchedness for which the cause was but too real
and manifest; acrimony for which no ground has been
shown or is to be surmised. What Mr. Dilke had done,
or could be supposed to have done, to merit the invalid’s
ire, is unapparent. Mr. Brown may be inferred, from
the verses of Keats already quoted, to have had the
general character and bearing of a <i>bon vivant</i> or “jolly
dog”; sufficiently versed in the good things of this world,
whether fish, flesh, or womankind; jocose, or on
occasion slangy. But Keats himself, in the nearly contemporary
letter in which he arraigned Miss Brawne for
“flirting with Brown,” had said: “I know his love and
friendship for me&mdash;at this moment I should be without
pence were it not for his assistance;” and we refuse to
think that any contingency could be likely to arise in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
which his “indecencies” would put Miss Brawne to the
blush. Be it enough for us to know that Keats, in the
drear prospect of expatriation and death, wrote in this
strain, and to wish it were otherwise.</p>

<p>The time had now arrived when Keats was to go to
Italy. It was on the 18th of September 1820 that he
embarked on the <i>Maria Crowther</i> from London. Haydon
gives us a painful glimpse of the poet shortly before his
departure: “The last time I saw him was at Hampstead,
lying on his back in a white bed, helpless, irritable, and
hectic. He had a book, and, enraged at his own feebleness,
seemed as if he were going out of the world, with a
contempt of this, and no hopes of a better. He muttered
as I stood by him that, if he did not recover, he
would ‘cut his throat.’ I tried to calm him, but to no
purpose. I left him, in great depression of spirit to see
him in such a state.” Another attached friend, of whom
I have not yet made mention, accompanied him; and in
the annals of watchful and self-oblivious friendship there
are few records more touching than the one which links
with the name of John Keats that of Joseph Severn.
Severn, two years older than Keats, had known him as far
back as 1813, being introduced by Mr. William Haslam.
Keats was then studying at Guy’s Hospital, but none the
less gave Severn “the complete idea of a poet.” The
acquaintance does not seem to have proceeded far at
that date; but, through the intervention of Mr. Edward
Holmes (author of a “Life of Mozart,” and “A Ramble
among the Musicians of Germany”) was renewed whilst
the poet was composing “Endymion”; and Severn may
probably have co-operated in some minor degree with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
Haydon in training Keats to a perception of the great
things in plastic art. In 1820 Severn, a student-painter
at the Royal Academy, had won the gold medal by his
picture of The Cave of Despair, from Spenser, entitling
him to the expenses of a three years’ stay in Italy,
for advancement in his art. He had an elegant gift in
music, as well as in painting; and it is a satisfaction to
learn that at this period he had “great animal spirits,” for
without these what he went through during the ensuing
five months would have been but too likely to break him
down. I must make room here for another letter from
Keats, one addressed to his good friend Brown, deeply
pathetic, and serving to assuage whatever may have been
like “brass upon our palate” in the last-quoted letter to
Fanny Brawne.</p>

<div class="blockquot1"><p class="center">
“<i>Saturday, September 28.</i><br />

“<i>Maria Crowther</i>, off Yarmouth, Isle of Wight.<br />
</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear Brown</span>,&mdash;The time has not yet come for
a <i>pleasant</i> letter from me. I have delayed writing to you
from time to time, because I felt how impossible it was to
enliven you with one heartening hope of my recovery.
This morning in bed the matter struck me in a different
manner. I thought I would write ‘while I was in some
liking,’ or I might become too ill to write at all, and then,
if the desire to have written should become strong, it
would be a great affliction to me. I have many more
letters to write, and I bless my stars that I have begun,
for time seems to press&mdash;this may be my best opportunity.</p>

<p>“We are in a calm, and I am easy enough this morning.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
If my spirits seem too low you may in some degree
impute it to our having been at sea a fortnight without
making any way. I was very disappointed at not meeting
you at Bedhampton, and am very provoked at the
thought of you being at Chichester to-day.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> I should
have delighted in setting off for London for the sensation
merely&mdash;for what should I do there? I could not
leave my lungs or stomach or other worse things behind
me.</p>

<p>“I wish to write on subjects that will not agitate me
much. There is one I must mention, and have done
with it. Even if my body would recover of itself,
this would prevent it. The very thing which I want to
live most for will be a great occasion of my death. I
cannot help it&mdash;who can help it? Were I in health, it
would make me ill, and how can I bear it in my state?
I daresay you will be able to guess on what subject I am
harping: you know what was my greatest pain during the
first part of my illness at your house. I wish for death
every day and night to deliver me from these pains; and
then I wish death away, for death would destroy even
those pains, which are better than nothing. Land and
sea, weakness and decline, are great separators; but
death is the great divorcer for ever. When the pang of
this thought has passed through my mind, I may say
the bitterness of death is past. I often wish for you,
that you might flatter me with the best.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>“I think, without my mentioning it, for my sake you
would be a friend to Miss Brawne when I am dead.
You think she has many faults: but for my sake think
she has not one. If there is anything you can do for
her by word or deed, I know you will do it. I am in a
state at present in which woman, merely as woman, can
have no more power over me than stocks and stones;
and yet the difference of my sensations with respect to
Miss Brawne and my sister is amazing. The one seems
to absorb the other to a degree incredible. I seldom
think of my brother and sister in America. The thought
of leaving Miss Brawne is beyond everything horrible&mdash;the
sense of darkness coming over me&mdash;I eternally see
her figure eternally vanishing. Some of the phrases she
was in the habit of using during my last nursing at
Wentworth Place ring in my ears. Is there another life?
Shall I awake and find all this a dream? There must
be&mdash;we cannot be created for this sort of suffering. The
receiving this letter is to be one of yours.</p>

<p>“I will say nothing about our friendship, or rather
yours to me, more than that, as you deserve to escape,
you will never be so unhappy as I am. I should think
of&mdash;you<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> in my last moments. I shall endeavour to
write to Miss Brawne if possible to-day.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> A sudden<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
stop to my life in the middle of one of these letters
would be no bad thing, for it keeps one in a sort of
fever awhile.</p>

<p>“Though fatigued with a letter longer than any I have
written for a long while, it would be better to go on for
ever than awake to a sense of contrary winds. We
expect to put into Portland Roads to-night. The captain,
the crew, and the passengers are all ill-tempered
and weary. I shall write to Dilke. I feel as if I was
closing my last letter to you.”</p></div>

<p>The ship at last proceeded on her voyage, and in the
Bay of Biscay encountered a severe squall. Keats soon
afterwards read the storm-scene in Byron’s “Don Juan":
he threw the book away in indignation, denouncing the
author’s perversity of mind which could “make solemn
things gay, and gay things solemn.” Late in October he
reached the harbour of Naples, and had to perform a
tedious quarantine of ten days. After landing on the
31st,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> he received a second letter from Shelley, then at
Pisa, urging him to come to that city. The first letter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
on this subject, dated in July, had invited Keats to the
hospitality of Shelley’s own house; but in November
this project had been given up, as “we are not rich
enough for that sort of thing”&mdash;although Shelley still
intended (so he wrote to Leigh Hunt) “to be the
physician both of his body and his soul,&mdash;to keep the
one warm, and to teach the other Greek and Spanish.”
Keats, however, had brought with him a letter of introduction
to Dr. (afterwards Sir James) Clark, in Rome,&mdash;or
indeed he may have met him before leaving England&mdash;and
he decided to proceed to Rome rather than Pisa.
Dr. Clark engaged for him a lodging opposite his own:
it was in the first house on the right as you ascend the
steps of the Trinità del Monte. The precise date when
Keats reached Rome, his last place of torture and of
rest, does not appear to be recorded: it was towards the
middle of November. He was at first able to walk out
a little, and occasionally to ride. Dr. Clark attended
his sick bed with the most exemplary assiduity and kindness.
He pronounced (so Keats wrote to Brown in a
letter of November 30th, which is perhaps the last he
ever penned) that the lungs were not much amiss, but
the stomach in a very bad condition: perhaps this was a
kindly equivocation, for by this time&mdash;as was ascertained
after his death&mdash;Keats can have had scarcely any lungs
at all. The patient was under no illusion as to his
prospects, and he more than once asked the physician
“When will this posthumous life of mine come to an
end?”</p>

<p>The only words in which the last days of Keats can
be adequately recorded are those of Severn: our best<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
choice would be between extract and silence. There
were oscillations from time to time, from bad to less bad,
but generally the tendency of the disease was steadily
downwards. The poet’s feelings regarding Fanny Brawne
were so acute and harrowing that he never mentioned
her to his friend. I give a few particulars from Severn’s
contemporary letters&mdash;the person addressed being not
always known.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“<i>December 14.</i> His suffering is so great, so continued,
and his fortitude so completely gone, that any further
change must make him delirious.</p>

<p>“<i>December 17.</i> Not a moment can I be from him. I
sit by his bed and read all day, and at night I humour
him in all his wanderings.... He rushed out of bed and
said ‘This day shall be my last,’ and but for me most
certainly it would. The blood broke forth in similar
quantity the next morning, and he was bled again. I
was afterwards so fortunate as to talk him into a little
calmness, and he soon became quite patient. Now the
blood has come up in coughing five times. Not a
single thing will he digest, yet he keeps on craving for
food. Every day he raves he will die from hunger, and
I’ve been obliged to give him more than was allowed....
Dr. Clark will not say much.... All that can be
done he does most kindly; while his lady, like himself
in refined feeling, prepares all that poor Keats takes, for&mdash;in
this wilderness of a place for an invalid&mdash;there was
no alternative.</p>

<p>[To Mrs. Brawne.] “<i>January 11.</i> He has now
given up all thoughts, hopes, or even wish, for recovery.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
His mind is in a state of peace, from the final leave he
has taken of this world, and all its future hopes.... I
light the fire, make his breakfast, and sometimes am
obliged to cook; make his bed, and even sweep the
room.... Oh I would my unfortunate friend had never
left your Wentworth Place for the hopeless advantages of
this comfortless Italy! He has many many times talked
over ‘the few happy days at your house, the only time
when his mind was at ease’.... Poor Keats cannot
see any letters&mdash;at least he will not; they affect him so
much, and increase his danger. The two last I repented
giving: he made me put them into his box, unread.</p>

<p>“<i>January 15.</i> Torlonia the banker has refused us
any more money. The bill is returned unaccepted, and
to-morrow I must pay my last crown for this cursed
lodging-place: and what is more, if he dies, all the beds
and furniture will be burnt, and the walls scraped, and
they will come on me for a hundred pounds or more....
You see my hopes of being kept by the Royal
Academy will be cut off unless I send a picture in the
spring. I have written to Sir T. Lawrence.</p>

<p>“<i>February 12.</i> At times I have hoped he would
recover; but the doctor shook his head, and Keats would
not hear that he was better; the thought of recovery is
beyond everything dreadful to him.</p>

<p>[To Mrs. Brawne.] “<i>February 14.</i> His mind is
growing to great quietness and peace. I find this
change has its rise from the increasing weakness of his
body; but it seems like a delightful sleep to me, I have
been beating about in the tempest of his mind so long.
To-night he has talked very much to me, but so easily<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
that he at last fell into a pleasant sleep. He seems to
have comfortable dreams without nightmare. This will
bring on some change: it cannot be worse&mdash;it may be
better. Among the many things he has requested of me
to-night, this is the principal&mdash;that on his grave shall be
this, ‘Here lies one whose name was writ in water.’...
Such a letter has come! I gave it to Keats, supposing
it to be one of yours; but it proved sadly otherwise.
The glance of that letter tore him to pieces. The effects
were on him for many days. He did not read it&mdash;he
could not; but requested me to place it in his coffin,
together with a purse and letter (unopened) of his sister’s:
since which time he has requested me not to place <i>that</i>
letter in his coffin, but only his sister’s purse and letter,
with some hair. Then he found many causes of his
illness in the exciting and thwarting of his passions; but
I persuaded him to feel otherwise on this delicate point....
I have got an English nurse to come two hours every
other day.... He has taken half a pint of fresh milk:
the milk here is beautiful to all the senses&mdash;it is delicious.
For three weeks he has lived on it, sometimes taking a
pint and a half in a day.</p>

<p>“<i>February 22.</i> This morning, by the pale daylight,
the change in him frightened me: he has sunk in the
last three days to a most ghastly look.... He opens his
eyes in great doubt and horror; but, when they fall upon
me, they close gently, open quietly, and close again, till
he sinks to sleep.</p>

<p>“<i>February 27.</i> He is gone. He died with the most
perfect ease&mdash;he seemed to go to sleep. On the 23rd,
about four, the approaches of death came on. ‘Severn<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>&mdash;I&mdash;lift
me up. I am dying&mdash;I shall die easy. Don’t
be frightened: be firm, and thank God it has come.’
I lifted him up in my arms. The phlegm seemed boiling
in his throat, and increased until eleven, when he
gradually sank into death, so quiet that I still thought
he slept. I cannot say more now. I am broken down
by four nights’ watching, no sleep since, and my poor
Keats gone. Three days since the body was opened:
the lungs were completely gone. The doctors could not
imagine how he had lived these two months. I followed
his dear body to the grave on Monday [February 26th],
with many English.... The letters I placed in the
coffin with my own hand.”</p></div>

<p>No words of mine shall be added here to tarnish upon
the mirror of memory this image of a sacred death and
a sacred friendship.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV.</h2>


<p>We have now reached the close of a melancholy
history&mdash;that of the extinction, in a space of
less than twenty-six years, of a bright life foredoomed
by inherited disease. We turn to another subject&mdash;the
intellectual development and the writings of Keats,
what they were, and how they were treated. Here again
there are some sombre tints.</p>

<p>A minute anecdote, apparently quite authentic, shows
that a certain propensity to the jingle of rhyme was
innate in Keats: Haydon is our informant. “An old
lady (Mrs. Grafty, of Craven Street, Finsbury) told his
brother George&mdash;when, in reply to her question what
John was doing, he told her he had determined to become
a poet&mdash;that this was very odd; because when he
could just speak, instead of answering questions put to
him, he would always make a rhyme to the last word
people said, and then laugh.” This, however, is the only
rhyming-anecdote that we hear of Keats’s childhood or
mere boyhood: there is nothing to show that at school
he made the faintest attempt at verse-spinning. The
earliest known experiment of his is the “Imitation of
Spenser”&mdash;four Spenserian stanzas, beginning&mdash;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Now Morning from her orient chamber came,”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and very poor stanzas they are. This Imitation was
written while he was living at Edmonton, in his nineteenth
year, and thus there was nothing singularly precocious in
Keats, either in the age at which he began versifying, or
in the skill with which he first addressed himself to the
task. I might say more of other verses, juvenile in the
amplest sense of the term, but such remarks would
belong more properly to a later section of this volume.
I will therefore only observe here that the earliest poems
of his in which I can discern anything even distantly
approaching to poetic merit or to his own characteristic
style (and these distantly indeed) are the lines “To &mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Hadst thou lived in days of old,”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and “Calidore, a Fragment,”</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Young Calidore is paddling o’er the lake.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The dates of these two compositions are not stated, but
they were probably later than the opening of 1815, and
if so Keats would have been nearly or quite twenty when
he wrote them&mdash;and this is far remote from precocity.
Let us say then, once for all, that, whatever may be the
praise and homage due to Keats for ranking as one of
the immortals when he died aged twenty-five, no sort of
encomium can be awarded to him on the ground that,
when he first began, he began early and well. All his
rawest attempts, be it added to his credit, appear to have
been kept to himself; for Cowden Clarke, who was certainly
his chief literary confidant in those tentative days,
says that until Keats produced to him his sonnet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
“written on the day that Mr. Leigh Hunt left prison”
the youth’s attempts at verse-writing were to him unknown.
The 3rd of February 1815 was the day of
Hunt’s liberation, so that the endeavour had by this time
been going on in silence for something like a year or
more.</p>

<p>It was not till 1816&mdash;or let us say when he was just of
age&mdash;that Keats produced a truly excellent thing. This
is the sonnet “On first looking into Chapman’s Homer.”
A copy of Chapman’s translation had been lent to Cowden
Clarke; he and Keats sat up till daylight reading it, the
young poet shouting with delight, and by ten o’clock on
the following morning Keats sent the sonnet to Clarke.
It was therefore a sudden immediate inspiration, a little
rill of lava flowing out of a poetic volcano, solidified at
once. This is not only the first excellent thing written
by Keats&mdash;it is the <i>only</i> excellent thing contained in his
first volume of verse.</p>

<p>This volume came out (as already mentioned) in the
early spring of 1817. The sonnet dedicating the book
to Leigh Hunt, written off at a moment’s notice “when
the last proof-sheet was brought from the printer,” was
evidently composed in winter-time. The title of the
volume is “Poems by John Keats.” The motto on its
title-page is from Spenser&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“What more felicity can fall to creature<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than to enjoy delight with liberty?”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>&mdash;a motto embodying with considerable completeness the
feeling which is predominant in the volume, and generally
in Keats’s poetic works. We always feel “delight” to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
be his true element, whatever may be the undertone of
pathos opposed to it by poetic development and treatment,
and by adverse fate. “Liberty” also&mdash;a free
flight of the faculties, a rejection of conventional
trammels, whether in life or in verse&mdash;was highly
characteristic of him; and perhaps the youthful friend of
Hunt intended the word “liberty” to be understood by
his readers as having a certain political flavour as well.
In addition to some writings just specified, the volume
contained “I stood tiptoe upon a little hill”; the
three epistles “To George Felton Mathew” (who was a
gentleman of literary habits, afterwards employed in
administering the Poor Law), “To my brother George,”
and “To Charles Cowden Clarke”; sixteen sonnets; and
“Sleep and Poetry.” The question of the poetic deservings
of these compositions belongs more properly to our
final chapter. I shall here give only a few details bearing
upon the circumstances of their production. The poem
“I stood tiptoe” &amp;c. was written beside a gate near Caen
Wood, Highgate. It must have been begun in a summer,
no doubt that of 1816, and was still uncompleted in the
middle of December of that year. “The Epistle to
Mathew,” dated November 1815, testifies to the early
admiration of Keats for Thomas Chatterton; though the
dedication of “Endymion,” “Inscribed to the memory of
Thomas Chatterton,” was but poorly forestalled by such
lines as the following&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Where we may soft humanity put on,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sit and rhyme, and think on Chatterton,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that warm-hearted Shakspeare sent to meet him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Four laurelled spirits heavenward to entreat him.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>Moreover, the first of his youthful sonnets is addressed
to Chatterton. The “Epistle to George,” August 1816,
opens with a reference to “many a dreary hour” which
John Keats has passed, fearing he would never be able
to write good poetry, however much he might gaze
on sky, honey-bees, and the beauty of woman. The
“Epistle to Clarke,” September 1816, pays ample tribute
to the guidance which he had afforded to Keats into the
realms of poetry, and contains a couplet which has of
late been very often quoted&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Who read for me the sonnet swelling loudly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Up to its climax, and then dying proudly?”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The sonnet&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“O Solitude, if I must with thee dwell,”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>is the first thing that Keats ever published. It had previously
appeared in <i>The Examiner</i> for May 5, 1816, and
is clearly one of the best of these early sonnets. The
sonnet which begins with the unmetrical line&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“How many bards gild the lapses of time”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>was included in the very first batch of verses by Keats
which Cowden Clarke showed to Leigh Hunt. Hunt
expressed “unhesitating and prompt admiration” of some
other one among the compositions; and Horace Smith,
who was present, reading out the sonnet now before us,
praised as “a well-condensed expression” the contorted
and inefficient line&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“That distance of recognizance bereaves,”<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></div></div>

<p><i>i.e.</i> [sounds] which distance bereaves of recognizance, or,
in plain English, which are too distant to be recognized.
Two other sonnets are addressed to Haydon in a tone of
glowing laudation.</p>

<p>“Sleep and Poetry” is (if we except the sonnet upon
Chapman’s Homer) by far the most important poem in
the volume. It was written partly in Leigh Hunt’s
cottage at Hampstead, in the library-room, where a sofa-bed
had on one occasion been made up for Keats’s convenience,
and the latter lines in the poem refer to objects
of art which were kept in the room. Apart from the impressive
line which all readers remember, saying of
poetry&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“’Tis might half-slumbering on its own right arm,”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>there are several passages interesting as showing Keats’s
enthusiasm for the art in which he was now a beginner,
soon to be an adept&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Oh for ten years that I may overwhelm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Myself in poesy!”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>also</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">“The great end<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of poesy, that it should be a friend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To soothe the cares and lift the thoughts of man;”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and again</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“They shall be accounted poet-kings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who simply tell the most heart-easing things”&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>both of these being definitions in which we might imagine
Leigh Hunt to have borne his part, or at least notified<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
his concurrence. The following well-known diatribe is
also important, and should be kept in mind when we
come to speak of the reception accorded to Keats by
established critics, more or less of the old school. He
has been dilating on the splendours of British poetry of
the great era, say Spenser to Milton, and then proceeds&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Could all this be forgotten? Yes, a schism<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nurtured by foppery and barbarism<br /></span>

<span class="i0">His glories: with a puling infant’s force<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Holding a poor decrepit standard out<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Marked with most flimsy mottoes, and in large<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The name of one Boileau.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Zeal is generally pardonable. Keats’s was manifestly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
honest zeal, and flaming forth in the right direction. Yet
it would have been well for him to remember and indicate
that amid his “school of dolts,” bearing the flag of Boileau,
there had been some very strong and capable men,
notably Dryden and Pope, who could do several things
besides inlaying and clipping; nor could it be said that
the beauty of the world had been wholly blinked by so
pre-eminently descriptive a poet as Thomson; and, if we
were to read Boileau&mdash;which few of us do now-a-days,
and I daresay Keats was not one of the few&mdash;we should
probably find that his “mottoes” were much less concerned
with inlaying and clipping than with solid meaning
and studious congruity&mdash;qualities not totally contemptible,
but (be it acknowledged) very largely contemned by
Keats in that first slender performance of his adolescence
named “Poems, 1817.”</p>

<p>It has been said that this volume hardly went beyond
the circle of Keats’s personal friends; nor do I think this
statement can be far wrong, although one inquirer avers
that the book was “constantly alluded to in the prominent
periodicals.” The dictum of Keats himself stands
thus: “It was read by some dozen of my friends, who
liked it; and some dozen whom I was unacquainted with,
who did not.” Shelley cannot have been among the
friends who liked the volume, for he had recommended
Keats not to give it to the press. At any rate the publishers,
Messrs. Ollier, would after a very short while sell
it no more. Their letter to George Keats&mdash;who seems
to have been acting for John during the absence of the
latter in the Isle of Wight or at Margate&mdash;is too amusing
to be omitted:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot1"><p>“We regret that your brother ever requested us to
publish his book, or that our opinion of its talent should
have led us to acquiesce in undertaking it. We are,
however, much obliged to you for relieving us from the
unpleasant necessity of declining any further connexion
with it, which we must have done, as we think the
curiosity is satisfied and the sale has dropped. By far
the greater number of persons who have purchased it
from us have found fault with it in such plain terms that
we have in many cases offered to take the book back
rather than be annoyed with the ridicule which has time
after time been showered upon it. In fact, it was only
on Sunday last that we were under the mortification of
having our own opinion of its merits flatly contradicted
by a gentleman who told us he considered it ‘no better
than a take-in.’ These are unpleasant imputations for
any one in business to labour under; but we should have
borne them and concealed their existence from you had
not the style of your note shown us that such delicacy
would be quite thrown away. We shall take means without
delay for ascertaining the number of copies on hand,
and you shall be informed accordingly.</p>

<p>“3 Welbeck Street, 29th April 1817.”</p></div>

<p>I do not find that the after-fate of the “Poems” is
recorded: probably they were handed over to Messrs.
Taylor and Hessey, who undertook the publication of
“Endymion."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V.</h2>


<p>To “Endymion” we now have to turn. The early
verses of Keats (as well as the later ones) contain
numerous allusions to Grecian mythology&mdash;Muses, Apollo,
Pan, Narcissus, Endymion and Diana, &amp;c. For the most
part these early allusions are nothing more than tawdry
conventionalisms; so indeed are some of the later ones,
as for instance in the drama of “King Stephen,” written
in 1819, the schoolboy classicism of “2nd Captain”&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i16">“Royal Maud<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the thronged towers of Lincoln hath looked down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like Pallas from the walls of Ilion;”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and we cannot discover that any more credit is due to
Keats for dribbling out his tritenesses about Apollo and
the Muses than to any Akenside, Mason, or Hayley, of
them all. At times, however, there is a genuine tone of
<i>enjoyment</i> in these utterances sufficient to persuade us
that the subject had really taken possession of his mind,
and that he could feel Grecian mythology, not merely as
a convenient vehicle for rhetorical personifications, but
as an ever-vital embodiment of ideas of beauty in forms of
beauty. In the early and partly boyish poem, “I stood<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
tip-toe upon a little hill,” a good deal of space is devoted
to showing that classical myths are an outcome of eager
sensitiveness to the lovely things of Nature: the tales of
Psyche, Pan and Sirynx, Narcissus, are cited in confirmation&mdash;and
finally Diana and Endymion, in the following
lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Where had he been from whose warm head outflew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That sweetest of all songs, that ever new,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The wanderer by moonlight? to him bringing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shapes from the invisible world, unearthly singing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From out the middle air, from flowery nests,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Into some wondrous region he had gone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To search for thee, divine Endymion.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He was a poet, sure a lover too,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who stood on Latmus’ top what time there blew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soft breezes from the myrtle-vale below,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And brought&mdash;in faintness solemn, sweet, and slow&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A hymn from Dian’s temple, while upswelling<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Wept that such beauty should be desolate;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So in fine wrath some golden sounds he won,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">That followed thine and thy dear shepherd’s kisses:<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>Readers often go at a skating-pace over passages of this
kind, without very clearly realizing to themselves the gist
of the whole matter. I will therefore put the thing into
the most prosaic form, and say that what Keats substantially
intimates here is as follows:&mdash;The inventor of
the myth of Artemis and Endymion must have been a
poet and lover, who, standing on the hill of Latmos, and
hearing thence a sweet hymn wafted from the low-lying
temple of Artemis, while the pure maiden-like moon was
shining resplendently, felt a pang of pity for this loveless
moon or Artemis, and invented for her a lover in the
person of Endymion; and ever since then the myth
has lent additional beauty to the effects, beautiful as in
themselves they are, of moonlight. Without tying down
Keats too rigidly to this view of the genesis of the myth,
I may nevertheless point out that he wholly ignores as
participants both the spirit of religious devoutness, and
the device of allegorizing natural phænomena: the inventor
is simply a poet and lover, who thinks it a world
of pities that such a sweet maiden as Artemis should not
have a lover sooner or later. Invention prompted by
warmth of feeling is thus the sole motive-power recognized.
The final phrase “Was there a poet born?” may with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>out
violence be understood as implying, “Ought not the
loves of Artemis and Endymion to beget their poet, and
why should not I be that poet?” At all events, Keats
determined that he <i>would</i> be that poet; and, contemplating
the original invention of the myth from the point of
view which we have just analysed, he not unnaturally
treated it from a like point of view. The tale of Diana
and Endymion was not to be a monument of classic
antiquity re-stated in the timid, formal spirit of a school-exercise,
but an invention of a poet and lover, who,
acting under the spell of natural beauty, re-informs his
theme with poetic fancy, amorous ardour, and Nature’s
profusion of object and of imagery. And in this Keats
thought&mdash;and surely he rightly thought&mdash;that he would
be getting closer to the spirit of a Grecian myth than by
any cut-and-dry process of tame repetition or pulseless
decorum. He wanted the dell of wild flowers, and not
the <i>hortus siccus</i>.</p>

<p>“Endymion” was actually begun in the spring of 1817,
much about the same time when the volume “Poems”
was published. The first draft was completed (as we have
said) on the 28th of November 1817, and by the end of
the winter which opened the year 1818 no more probably
remained to be done to it. The MS. was subjected to
much revision and excision, so that it cannot be alleged
that Keats worked in a reckless temper, or without such
self-criticism as he could at that date bring to bear. It
would even appear, moreover, from the terms of a letter
which he addressed to Mr. Taylor, on April 27, 1818,
that he allowed that gentleman to make some volunteer
corrections of his own. Haydon had spurred him on to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
the ambitious attempt, which Hunt on the contrary deprecated.
Shelley&mdash;so the story goes&mdash;agreed with Keats
that each of them should write an epic within a space of
six months. Shelley produced “The Revolt of Islam,”
Keats the “Endymion.” Shelley proved to be the more
rapid writer of the two; for his poem of 4815 lines was
finished by the early autumn of 1817, while Keats’s,
numbering 4,050 lines, went on through the winter which
opened 1818. A good deal of it had been done during
Keats’s sojourn with Mr. Bailey, in Magdalen Hall,
Oxford. Afterwards, on 8th October 1817, he wrote to
Bailey&mdash;“I refused to visit Shelley, that I might have
my own unfettered scope;” an expression which one
might be inclined to understand as showing that Shelley,
having now completed “The Revolt of Islam,” had invited
Keats to visit him at Marlow, and there to proceed with
“Endymion,”&mdash;not without the advantage it may well be
supposed, of Shelley’s sympathizing but none the less
stringent counsel. Bailey’s account of the facts may
be given here. “He wrote and I read&mdash;sometimes
at the same table, sometimes at separate desks&mdash;from
breakfast till two or three o’clock. He sat down to
his task, which was about fifty lines a day, with his paper
before him, and wrote with as much regularity and
apparently with as much ease as he wrote his letters.
Indeed, he quite acted up to the principle he lays down,
‘That, if poetry comes not as naturally as the leaves of a
tree, it had better not come at all.’ Sometimes he fell
short of his allotted task, but not often, and he would
make it up another day. But he never forced himself.
When he had finished his writing for the day, he usually<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
read it over to me, and then read or wrote letters till we
went out for a walk.” The first book of the poem was
delivered into the hands of the publisher, Mr. Taylor, in
the middle of January. Haydon undertook to make a
finished chalk-sketch of the author’s head, to be prefixed
to the volume; he drew outlines accordingly, but the
volume, an octavo, appeared in April without any portrait.
We all know the now proverbial first line in “Endymion,”</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“A thing of beauty is a joy for ever.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This seems to have been an inspiration of long anterior
date; for Mr. Stephens, the surgical fellow-student and
fellow-lodger of Keats, says that in one twilight when they
were together the youthful poet produced the line&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“A thing of beauty is a constant joy;”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>which, failing wholly to satisfy its author’s ear, was immediately
afterwards improved into its present form.
Even before handing over any part of his MS. to the
printer, Keats, at the “immortal dinner” which came off
in Haydon’s painting-room, on the 28th of December
1817, and at which Wordsworth, Lamb, and others, were
present, had bespoken a strange and heroic fate for one
copy of his book; for he made Mr. Ritchie, who was
about to set forth on an African exploration, promise
that he would carry the volume “to the great desert of
Sahara, and fling it in the midst.”</p>

<p>“Invention” was the quality which Keats most sought
for in his “Endymion,” as shown in his letter to Mr.
Bailey, already cited. He said&mdash;“It [‘Endymion’] will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
be a test of my powers of imagination, and chiefly of
my invention&mdash;which is a rare thing indeed&mdash;by which I
must make 4000 lines of one bare circumstance, and fill
them with poetry.... A long poem is a test of Invention,
which I take to be the polar star of poetry, as Fancy
is the sails, and Imagination the rudder.... This
same Invention seems indeed of late years to have been
forgotten as a poetical excellence.” The term “invention”
might be used in various senses. Keats seems to
have meant the power of producing a great number of
minor incidents, illustrative images, and other particulars,
all tending to reinforce and fill out the main conception
and subject-matter.</p>

<p>Keats wrote a preface to “Endymion” on March 19,
1818, which was objected to by Hamilton Reynolds, and
by his friends generally. It was certainly off-hand and
unconciliating, and some readers would have regarded it
as defiant. Its general purport was that the poem was
faulty, but the author would not keep it back for revision,
which would make the performance a tedium to himself,
“I have written to please myself, and in hopes to
please others, and for a love of fame.” There was a good
deal more, jaunty and provocative enough. Keats was
not well inclined to suppress this preface. He replied on
April 9th to Reynolds in a letter from which some weighty
words must be quoted:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“I have not the slightest feeling of humility towards
the public, or to anything in existence but the Eternal
Being, the principle of Beauty, and the memory of great
men.... A preface is written to the public&mdash;a thing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
I cannot help looking upon as an enemy, and which
I cannot address without feelings of hostility.... I
would be subdued before my friends, and thank them
for subduing me; but among multitudes of men I have
no feel of stooping&mdash;I hate the idea of humility to them.
I never wrote one single line of poetry with the least
shadow of public thought.... I hate a mawkish popularity.
I cannot be subdued before them. My glory
would be to daunt and dazzle the thousand jabberers
about pictures and books.”</p></div>

<p>Keats, however, yielded to his censors, and wrote a
rather shorter preface, by far a better one. It bears the
date of April 10th, being the very next day after he had
written to Reynolds in so unsubmissive a tone. This
second preface says substantially much the same thing as
the first, but without any aggressive or “devil-may-care”
addenda. It is too important to be omitted here:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Knowing within myself the manner in which this
poem has been produced, it is not without a feeling of
regret that I make it public. What manner I mean will
be quite clear to the reader, who must soon perceive
great inexperience, immaturity, and every error denoting a
feverish attempt rather than a deed accomplished. The
two first books, and indeed the two last, I feel sensible,
are not of such completion as to warrant their passing
the press; nor should they, if I thought a year’s castigation
would do them any good. It will not: the foundations
are too sandy. It is just that this youngster should
die away&mdash;a sad thought for me, if I had not some hope<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
that, while it is dwindling, I may be plotting, and fitting
myself for verses fit to live.</p>

<p>“This may be speaking too presumptuously, and may
deserve a punishment. But no feeling man will be forward
to inflict it; he will leave me alone with the conviction
that there is not a fiercer hell than the failure in
a great object. This is not written with the least atom
of purpose to forestall criticisms of course, but from the
desire I have to conciliate men who are competent to
look, and who do look, with a zealous eye to the honour
of English literature.</p>

<p>“The imagination of a boy is healthy, and the mature
imagination of a man is healthy. But there is a space of
life between in which the soul is in a ferment, the character
undecided, the way of life uncertain, the ambition
thick-sighted. Thence proceeds mawkishness, and all
the thousand bitters which those men I speak of must
necessarily taste in going over the following pages.</p>

<p>“I hope I have not in too late a day touched the
beautiful mythology of Greece, and dulled its brightness;
for I wish to try once more before I bid it farewell.”</p></div>

<p>No one can deny that this is a modest preface; it is in
fact too modest, and concedes to the adversary the utmost
which could possibly be at issue, viz., whether the
poem was worth publishing or not. The only scintilla
of self-assertion in it is the hope expressed-“<i>some</i> hope”&mdash;that
the writer might eventually produce “verses fit to
live;” and less than that no man who puts a poem before
the public could be expected to postulate. Keats must
therefore be expressly acquitted of having done anything<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
to excite animosity or retaliation on the part of his critics;
the sole thing which could be attacked was the poem
itself&mdash;too frankly pronounced indefensible&mdash;or else something
in the author which did not appear within the
covers of his volume. The preface is indeed manly as
well as modest; there is not a servile or obsequious word
in it; yet I cannot help thinking that Keats, when later
on he found “Endymion” denounced as drivel, must at
times have wished that he had been a little less deferential
to Reynolds’s objections, and had not so explicitly
admitted that not one of the four books of the poem was
qualified to “pass the press.” An adverse reviewer was
sure to take advantage of that admission, and did so.</p>

<p>It would be interesting to compare with the preface
which Keats printed for “Endymion” the one which
Shelley printed for “The Revolt of Islam.” Shelley, like
Keats, was modest; he left his readers to settle any question
as to his poetic claims (although “Alastor,” previously
published, might pretty well have vouched
for these); but he resolutely explained that reviewers
would find in him no subject for bullying. I can only
make room for a few sentences:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“The experience and the feelings to which I refer do
not in themselves constitute men poets, but only prepare
them to be the auditors of those who are. How far I
shall be found to possess that more essential attribute of
poetry, the power of awakening in others sensations like
those which animate my own bosom, is that which, to
speak sincerely, I know not, and which, with an acquiescent
and contented spirit, I expect to be taught by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
effect which I shall produce upon those whom I now
address.... It is the misfortune of this age that its
writers, too thoughtless of immortality, are exquisitely
sensible to temporary praise or blame. They write with
the fear of reviews before their eyes. This system of
criticism sprang up in that torpid interval when poetry
was not. Poetry, and the art which professes to regulate
and limit its powers, cannot subsist together.... I have
sought, therefore, to write (as I believe that Homer,
Shakespeare, and Milton wrote) in utter disregard of
anonymous censure.”</p></div>

<p>The publisher of “Endymion” (Mr. Taylor is probably
meant) was nervous as to the reception which potent
critics would accord to the volume. He went to William
Gifford, the editor of the <i>Quarterly Review</i>, to bespeak
indulgence, but found a Cerberus who rejected every sop.
In the number of the <i>Quarterly</i> for April 1818&mdash;not
actually published, it would seem, until September&mdash;appeared
a critique branded into ignominious permanence
by the name and fame of Keats. Gifford himself
is regarded as its author. As an account of Keats’s
career would for various reasons be incomplete in the
absence of this critique, I reproduce it here. It has the
merit of brevity, and lends itself hardly at all to curtailment,
but I miss one or two details, relating chiefly to
Leigh Hunt.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Reviewers have been sometimes accused of not
reading the works which they affected to criticize. On
the present occasion we shall anticipate the author’s
complaint, and honestly confess that we have not read<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
his work. Not that we have been wanting in our duty;
far from it; indeed, we have made efforts, almost as superhuman
as the story itself appears to be, to get through it:
but, with the fullest stretch of our perseverance, we are
forced to confess that we have not been able to struggle
beyond the first of the four books of which this Poetic
Romance consists. We should extremely lament this
want of energy, or whatever it may be, on our parts,
were it not for one consolation&mdash;namely, that we are no
better acquainted with the meaning of the book through
which we have so painfully toiled than we are with that
of the three which we have not looked into.</p>

<p>“It is not that Mr. Keats (if that be his real name,
for we almost doubt that any man in his senses would
put his real name to such a rhapsody)&mdash;it is not, we say,
that the author has not powers of language, rays of fancy,
and gleams of genius. He has all these; but he is unhappily
a disciple of the new school of what has been
somewhere called ‘Cockney Poetry,’ which may be
defined to consist of the most incongruous ideas in the
most uncouth language.</p>

<p>“Of this school Mr. Leigh Hunt, as we observed in a
former number, aspires to be the hierophant.... This
author is a copyist of Mr. Hunt, but he is more unintelligible,
almost as rugged, twice as diffuse, and ten times
more tiresome and absurd, than his prototype, who,
though he impudently presumed to seat himself in the
chair of criticism, and to measure his own poetry by his
own standard, yet generally had a meaning. But Mr.
Keats had advanced no dogmas which he was bound to
support by examples. His nonsense, therefore, is quite<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
gratuitous; he writes it for its own sake, and, being bitten
by Mr. Leigh Hunt’s insane criticism, more than rivals
the insanity of his poetry.</p>

<p>“Mr. Keats’s preface hints that his poem was produced
under peculiar circumstances. ‘Knowing within myself,’
he says, ‘the manner [&amp;c., down to ‘a deed accomplished’].
We humbly beg his pardon, but this does
not appear to us to be ‘quite so clear;’ we really do not
know what he means. But the next passage is more
intelligible. ‘The two first books, and indeed the two
last, I feel sensible, are not of such completion as to
warrant their passing the press.’ Thus ‘the two first
books’ are, even in his own judgment, unfit to appear,
and ‘the two last’ are, it seems, in the same condition;
and, as two and two make four, and as that is the whole
number of books, we have a clear, and we believe a very
just, estimate of the entire work.</p>

<p>“Mr. Keats, however, deprecates criticism on this
‘immature and feverish work’ in terms which are themselves
sufficiently feverish; and we confess that we should
have abstained from inflicting upon him any of the tortures
of the ‘fierce hell’ of criticism<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> which terrify his
imagination if he had not begged to be spared in order
that he might write more; if we had not observed in him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
a certain degree of talent which deserves to be put in the
right way, or which at least ought to be warned of the
wrong; and if finally he had not told us that he is of an
age and temper which imperiously require mental discipline.</p>

<p>“Of the story we have been able to make out but
little. It seems to be mythological, and probably relates
to the loves of Diana and Endymion; but of this, as the
scope of the work has altogether escaped us, we cannot
speak with any degree of certainty, and must therefore
content ourselves with giving some instances of its diction
and versification. And here again we are perplexed
and puzzled. At first it appeared to us that Mr. Keats
had been amusing himself and wearying his readers with
an immeasurable game at <i>bouts rimés</i>; but, if we recollect
rightly, it is an indispensable condition at this play that
the rhymes, when filled up, shall have a meaning; and
our author, as we have already hinted, has no meaning.
He seems to us to write a line at random, and then he
follows, not the thought excited by this line, but that
suggested by the <i>rhyme</i> with which it concludes. There
is hardly a complete couplet enclosing a complete idea in
the whole book. He wanders from one subject to
another, from the association, not of ideas, but of
sounds; and the work is composed of hemistichs which,
it is quite evident, have forced themselves upon the
author by the mere force of the catchwords on which
they turn.</p>

<p>“We shall select, not as the most striking instance, but
as that least liable to suspicion, a passage from the
opening of the poem.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i9">‘Such the sun, the moon,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">That for themselves a cooling covert make<br /></span>

<p>Here it is clear that the word, and not the idea, <i>moon</i>,
produces the simple sheep and their shady <i>boon</i>, and that
‘the <i>dooms</i> of the mighty dead’ would never have intruded
themselves but for the ‘fair musk-rose <i>blooms</i>.’</p>

<p>Here Apollo’s <i>fire</i> produces a <i>pyre</i>&mdash;a silvery pyre&mdash;of

words, is the sum and substance of six lines.</p>

<p>“We come now to the author’s taste in versification.
He cannot indeed write a sentence, but perhaps he may
be able to spin a line. Let us see. The following are
specimens of his prosodial notions of our English heroic

<p>“By this time our readers must be pretty well satisfied
as to the meaning of his sentences and the structure of
his lines. We now present them with some of the new<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
words with which, in imitation of Mr. Leigh Hunt, he
adorns our language.</p>

<p>“We are told that turtles <i>passion</i> their voices; that an
arbour was <i>nested</i>, and a lady’s locks <i>gordianed</i> up; and,
to supply the place of the nouns thus verbalized, Mr.
Keats, with great fecundity, spawns new ones, such as
men-slugs and human <i>serpentry</i>, the <i>honey-feel</i> of bliss,
wives prepare <i>needments</i>, and so forth.</p>

<p>“Then he has formed new verbs by the process of
cutting off their natural tails, the adverbs, and affixing
them to their foreheads. Thus the wine out-sparkled, the
multitude up-followed, and night up-took; the wind up-blows,
and the hours are down-sunken. But, if he sinks
some adverbs in the verbs, he compensates the language
with adverbs and adjectives which he separates from the
parent stock. Thus a lady whispers <i>pantingly</i> and close,
makes <i>hushing</i> signs, and steers her skiff into a <i>ripply</i>
cove, a shower falls <i>refreshfully</i>, and a vulture has a
<i>spreaded</i> tail.</p>

<p>“But enough of Mr. Leigh Hunt and his simple
neophyte. If any one should be bold enough to purchase
this ‘Poetic Romance,’ and so much more patient
than ourselves as to get beyond the first book, and so
much more fortunate as to find a meaning, we entreat
him to make us acquainted with his success. We shall
then return to the task which we now abandon in despair,
and endeavour to make all due amends to Mr. Keats
and to our readers.”</p></div>

<p>Such is the too famous article in <i>The Quarterly Review</i>.
If its contents are to be assessed with perfect calmness,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
I should have to say that it is not mistaken in alleging
that the poem of “Endymion” is rambling and indistinct;
that Keats allowed himself to drift too readily according
to the bidding of his rhymes (Leigh Hunt has acknowledged
as much, in independent remarks of his own);
that many words are coined, and badly coined; and that
the versification is not free from blemishes&mdash;although
several of the lines quoted by <i>The Quarterly</i> as unmetrical,
are, when read with the right emphasis, blameless, or even
sonorous. But the article is none the less a despicable
and odious performance; partly as being a sneering
depreciation of a work showing rich poetic endowment,
and partly as being, not a deliberate and candid (however
severe) estimate of Keats as a poet, but really an utterance
of malice prepense, and hardly disguised, against
Hunt as a hostile politician who wrote poetry, and against
any one who consorted with him. The inverting of the
due balance between the merits and the defects of
“Endymion,” would have been at best an act of stupidity;
at second best, after the author’s preface had been laid
to heart, an act of brutalism; and at worst, when the
venom of abuse was poured into the poetic cup of Keats
as an expedient for drugging the political cup of Hunt,
an act of partisan turpitude. No more words need be
wasted upon a proceeding of which the abiding and unevadeable
literary record is graven in the brass of
Shelley’s “Adonais.”</p>

<p>The attack in <i>The Quarterly Review</i> was accompanied
by attacks in <i>Blackwood’s Magazine</i>. If <i>The Quarterly</i>
was carping and ill-natured, <i>Blackwood</i> was basely insulting.
A series of articles “On the Cockney School of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
Poetry” began in the Scotch magazine in October
1817, being directed mainly, and with calumnious virulence,
against Leigh Hunt. No. 4 of the series came
out in August 1818, and formed a vituperation of
Keats. I will not draw upon its stores of underbred
jocularity, so as to show that the best raillery which
<i>Blackwood</i> could get up consisted of terming him
Johnny Keats, and referring to his having been
assistant to an “apothecary.” The author of these
papers signed himself Z, being no doubt too noble and
courageous to traduce people without muffling himself in
anonymity; nor did he consent to uncloak, though
vigorously pressed by Hunt to do so. It is affirmed that
Z was Lockhart, the son-in-law of Sir Walter Scott, and
afterwards editor of <i>The Quarterly Review</i>; and an unpleasant
adjunct to this statement&mdash;we would gladly
disbelieve it&mdash;is that Scott himself lent active aid in concocting
the articles. A different account is that Z was at
first John Wilson (Christopher North), revised by William
Blackwood, but that the article on Keats was due to
Lockhart.</p>

<p>Few literary questions of the last three-quarters of a
century have been regarded from more absolutely different
points of view than the problem&mdash;How did Keats
receive the attacks made upon his poem and himself?
From an early date in the controversy three points seem
to have been very generally agreed upon: (1) That
“Endymion” is (as Shelley judiciously phrased it), “a
poem considerably defective;” (2) that the attacks upon
it were, in essence, partly true, but so biassed&mdash;so keen of
scent after defects, and so dull of vision for beauties&mdash;as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
to be practically unfair and perverse in a marked degree;
and (3) that the unfairness and perversity <i>quoad</i> Keats
were wilful devices of literary and especially of political
spite <i>quoad</i> a knot of writers among whom Leigh Hunt
was the central figure. The question remains&mdash;In what
spirit did Keats meet his critics? Was he greatly distressed,
or defiant and retaliatory, or substantially indifferent?</p>

<p>Among the documents of Keats’s life I find few records
strictly contemporary with the events themselves, serving
to settle this point. When the abuse of Z against Hunt
began, Keats was indignant and combative. He said in
a letter which may belong to October 1817&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“There has been a flaming attack upon Hunt in the
Edinburgh magazine.... There has been but one
number published&mdash;that on Hunt, to which they have
prefixed a motto by one Cornelius Webb, ‘Poetaster,’
who unfortunately was one of our party occasionally at
Hampstead, and took it into his head to write the following
(something about)&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘We’ll talk on Wordsworth, Byron,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A theme we never tire on,’<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and so forth till he came to Hunt and Keats. In the
motto they have put ‘Hunt and Keats’ in large letters.
I have no doubt that the second number was intended
for me, but have hopes of its non-appearance.... I
don’t mind the thing much; but, if he should go to such
lengths with me as he has done with Hunt, I must infallibly
call him to an account, if he be a human being,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
and appears in squares and theatres where we might
‘possibly meet.’ I don’t relish his abuse.”</p></div>

<p>It is worth observing also that, in a paper “On Kean
as Richard Duke of York” which Keats published on
December 28, 1817, he wrote: “The English people do
not care one fig about Shakespeare, only as he flatters
their pride and their prejudices;... it is our firm
opinion.” If he thought that English indifference to
Shakespeare was of this degree of density, he must surely
have been prepared for a considerable amount of apathy
in relation to any poem by John Keats.</p>

<p>On October 9, 1818, just after the spiteful notices of
himself in <i>Blackwood</i> and <i>The Quarterly</i> had appeared,
and had been replied to in <i>The Morning Chronicle</i> by
two correspondents signing J. S. and R. B., Keats wrote
as follows to his publisher Mr. Hessey; and to treat the
affair in a more self-possessed, measured, and dignified
spirit, would not have been possible:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“You are very good in sending me the letters from
<i>The Chronicle</i>, and I am very bad in not acknowledging
such a kindness sooner; pray forgive me. It has so
chanced that I have had that paper every day. I have
seen to-day’s. I cannot but feel indebted to those gentlemen
who have taken my part. As for the rest, I begin
to get a little acquainted with my own strength and weakness.
Praise or blame has but a momentary effect on the
man whose love of beauty in the abstract makes him a
severe critic on his own works. My own domestic
criticism has given me pain without comparison beyond
what <i>Blackwood</i> or <i>The Quarterly</i> could possibly inflict;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
and also, when I feel I am right, no external praise can
give me such a glow as my own solitary reperception and
ratification of what is fine. J. S. is perfectly right in
regard to the ‘slipshod “Endymion.”’<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> That it is so is
no fault of mine. No; though it may sound a little
paradoxical, it is as good as I had power to make it by
myself. Had I been nervous about its being a perfect
piece, and with that view asked advice, and trembled
over every page, it would not have been written, for it is
not in my nature to fumble. I will write independently.
I have written independently, <i>without judgment</i>: I may
write independently, and <i>with judgment</i>, hereafter. The
genius of poetry must work out its own salvation in a
man. It cannot be matured by law and precept, but by
sensation and watchfulness in itself. That which is
creative must create itself. In ‘Endymion’ I leaped
headlong into the sea, and thereby have become better
acquainted with the soundings, the quicksands, and the
rocks, than if I had stayed upon the green shore and
piped a silly pipe, and took tea and comfortable advice.
I was never afraid of failure, for I would sooner fail than
not be among the greatest. But I am nigh getting into
a rant; so, with remembrances to Taylor and Woodhouse,
&amp;c., I am yours very sincerely,</p>

<p class="ralign1">
“<span class="smcap">John Keats.</span>”
</p></div>

<p>This letter, equally moderate and wide-reaching, proves
conclusively that Keats, at the time when he wrote it,
treated depreciatory criticism in exactly the right spirit;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
acknowledging that it was not without a certain <i>raison
d’être</i>, but affirming that he could for himself see much
further and much deeper in the same direction, and in
others as well. On October 29, 1818, he wrote to his
brother George:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Reynolds... persuades me to publish my ‘Pot of
Basil’ as an answer to the attack made on me in <i>Blackwood’s
Magazine</i> and <i>The Quarterly Review</i>.... I think
I shall be among the English poets after my death. Even
as a matter of present interest, the attempt to crush me
in <i>The Quarterly</i> has only brought me more into notice,
and it is a common expression among book-men, ‘I
wonder <i>The Quarterly</i> should cut its own throat.’ It
does me not the least harm in society to make me appear
little and ridiculous. I know when a man is superior to
me, and give him all due respect; he will be the last to
laugh at me; and as for the rest, I feel that I make an
impression upon them which ensures me personal respect
while I am in sight, whatever they may say when my back
is turned.... The only thing that can ever affect me
personally for more than one short passing day is any
doubt about my powers for poetry. I seldom have any;
and I look with hope to the nighing time when I shall
have none.”</p></div>

<p>Towards December 1818 he wrote in a similarly contented
strain to George Keats and his wife: “You will
be glad to hear that Gifford’s attack upon me has done
me service; it has got my book among several <i>sets</i>.” The
same letter mentions a sonnet, and a bank-note for £25<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
received from an unknown admirer. However, the next
letter to the same correspondents, February 19, 1819,
clearly attests some annoyance.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“My poem has not at all succeeded.... The reviewers
have enervated men’s minds, and made them indolent;
few think for themselves. These reviews are getting
more and more powerful, especially <i>The Quarterly</i>. They
are like a superstition which, the more it prostrates the
crowd and the longer it continues, the more it becomes
powerful, just in proportion to their increasing weakness.
I was in hopes that, as people saw (as they must do now)
all the trickery and iniquity of these plagues, they would
scout them. But no; they are like the spectators at the
Westminster cockpit; they like the battle, and do not
care who wins or who loses.... I have been at different
times turning it in my head whether I should go to
Edinburgh and study for a physician.... It is not
worse than writing poems, and hanging them up to be
fly-blown in the Review shambles.”</p></div>

<p>We find in Keats’s letters nothing further about the
criticisms; but, when he replied in August 1820 to
Shelley’s first invitation to Italy, he referred to “Endymion”
itself: “I am glad you take any pleasure in my poor
poem, which I would willingly take the trouble to unwrite
if possible, did I care so much as I have done about
reputation.” We must also take into account the
publishers’ advertisement (not Keats’s own) to the
“Lamia” volume, saying of “Hyperion”&mdash;“The poem
was intended to have been of equal length with
‘Endymion,’ but the reception given to that work<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
discouraged the author from proceeding.” It can
scarcely be supposed that the publishers printed this
without Keats’s express sanction; yet he never assigned
elsewhere any similar reason for discontinuing “Hyperion,”
nor was “Hyperion” open to exception on
any such grounds as had been urged against “Endymion.”</p>

<p>The earliest written reference which I can trace to any
serious despondency of Keats consequent upon the
attacks of reviewers (if we except a less strongly worded
statement by Leigh Hunt, to be quoted further on) is in
a letter which Shelley wrote, but did not eventually send,
to the editor of the <i>Quarterly Review</i>. It was written
after Shelley had seen the “Lamia” volume, and can
hardly, I suppose, date earlier than October 1820, two
full years after the publication of the <i>Quarterly</i> (and also
the <i>Blackwood</i>) tirades against “Endymion.” Shelley
adverts, with great reserve of tone, to the <i>Quarterly</i>
critique, and then proceeds&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Poor Keats was thrown into a dreadful state of mind
by this review, which I am persuaded was not written
with any intention of producing the effect (to which it
has at least greatly contributed) of embittering his existence,
and inducing a disease from which there are now
but faint hopes of his recovery. The first effects are
described to me to have resembled insanity, and it was
by assiduous watching that he was restrained from effecting
purposes of suicide. The agony of his sufferings at
length produced the rupture of a blood-vessel in the
lungs, and the usual process of consumption appears to
have begun.”</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>The informants of Shelley with regard to Keats’s acute
feelings and distress were (it is stated) the Gisbornes,
and possibly Leigh Hunt may have confirmed them in
some measure; but the Gisbornes knew nothing directly
of what had been taking place in England in or about
the autumn of 1818, and that which Hunt published
regarding Keats is far from corroborating so extreme a
view of the facts. Later on Shelley received from Mr.
Gisborne a letter written by Colonel Finch, the date of
which would perhaps be in May 1821 (three months
after the death of Keats). This letter appears to have
been one of his principal incentives for the indignation
expressed in the preface to “Adonais,” but not in the
poem itself, which had been completed before Shelley
saw the letter; and it is remarkable that Colonel Finch’s
expressions, when one scrutinizes them, do not really say
anything about mental anguish caused to Keats by any
review, but only by ill-treatment of a different kind&mdash;seemingly
that of his brother George and others, as
previously detailed. The following is the only relevant
passage: “He left his native shores by sea in a merchant
vessel for Naples, where he arrived, having received no
benefit during the passage, and brooding over the most
melancholy and mortifying reflections, and nursing a
deeply-rooted disgust to life and to the world, owing to
having been infamously treated by the very persons whom
his generosity had rescued from want and woe.” Shelley
however put into print in the preface to “Adonais” the
same view of the blighting of Keats’s life by the <i>Quarterly</i>
critique (he seems to have known nothing of the <i>Blackwood</i>
scurrility), which had appeared in his undespatched
letter to the editor of the <i>Quarterly</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“The savage criticism on his ‘Endymion’ which
appeared in <i>The Quarterly Review</i> produced the most
violent effect on his susceptible mind. The agitation
thus originated ended in the rupture of a blood-vessel in
the lungs. A rapid consumption ensued, and the
succeeding acknowledgments from more candid critics of
the true greatness of his powers were ineffectual to heal
the wound thus wantonly inflicted.... Miserable man!
you, one of the meanest, have wantonly defaced one of
the noblest specimens of the workmanship of God. Nor
shall it be your excuse that, murderer as you are, you
have spoken daggers but used none.”</p></div>

<p>Thus far we have found no strong evidence (only
assertions) that Keats took greatly to heart the attacks
upon him, whether in the <i>Quarterly</i> or in <i>Blackwood</i>.
Shelley seems to be the principal authority, and Shelley,
unless founding upon some adequate information, is next
to no authority at all. He had left England in March
1818, five months before the earlier&mdash;printed in August&mdash;of
these spiteful articles. Were there nothing further, we
should be more than well pleased to rally to the opinion
of Lord Houghton, who came to the conclusion that the
idea of Keats’s extreme sensitiveness to criticism was a
positive delusion&mdash;that he paid little heed to it, and pursued
his own course much as if no reviewer had tried to
be provoking. But there is, in fact, a direct witness of
high importance&mdash;Haydon. Haydon knew Keats very
intimately, and saw a great deal of him; he admired and
loved him, and had a vigorous, discerning insight into
character and habit of mind, such as makes his observa<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>tions
about all sorts of men substantial testimony and
first-rate reading. He took forcible views of many
things, and sometimes exaggerated views: but, when he
attributed to Keats a particular mood of feeling, I should
find it very difficult to think that he was either unfairly
biassed or widely mistaken. In his reminiscences
proper to the year 1817-18 occurs the following
passage:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“The assaults on Hunt in <i>Blackwood</i> at this time,
under the signature of Z, were incessant. Who Z was
nobody knew, but I myself strongly suspect him to have
been Terry the actor. Leigh Hunt had exasperated
Terry by neglecting to notice his theatrical efforts. Terry
was a friend of Sir Walter’s, shared keenly his political
hatreds, and was also most intimate with the Blackwood
party, which had begun a course of attacks on all who
showed the least liberalism of thinking, or who were
praised by or known to <i>The Examiner</i>. Hunt had
addressed a sonnet to me. This was enough: we were
taken to be of the same clique of rebels, rascals, and
reformers, who were supposed to support that production
of so much power and talent. On Keats the effect was
melancholy. He became morbid and silent; would call
and sit whilst I was painting, for hours, without speaking
a word.”</p></div>

<p>This counts for something&mdash;not very much. But
another passage forming an entry in Haydon’s diary,
written on March 29, 1821, perhaps as soon as he had
heard of Keats’s death, carries the matter much further<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“He began life full of hopes, fiery, impetuous, and
ungovernable, expecting the world to fall at once beneath
his powers. Poor fellow! his genius had no sooner
begun to bud than hatred and malice spat their poison
on its leaves, and, sensitive and young, it shrivelled
beneath their effusions. Unable to bear the sneers of
ignorance or the attacks of envy, not having strength of
mind enough to buckle himself together like a porcupine
and present nothing but his prickles to his enemies, he
began to despond, and flew to dissipation as a relief,
which, after a temporary elevation of spirits, plunged him
into deeper despondency than ever. For six weeks he
was scarcely sober, and (to show what a man does to
gratify his appetites when once they get the better of him)
once covered his tongue and throat as far as he could
reach with cayenne pepper in order to appreciate the
‘delicious coldness<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> of claret in all its glory'&mdash;his own
expression.”</p></div>

<p>Immediately afterwards, April 21, 1821, Haydon wrote
a letter to Miss Mitford, repeating, with some verbal
variations, what is said above, and adding several other
particulars concerning Keats. The opening phrase runs
thus: “Keats was a victim to personal abuse, and want
of nerve to bear it. Ought he to have sunk in that way
because a few quizzers told him that he was an apothecary's
apprentice?” And further on&mdash;“I remonstrated
on his absurd dissipation, but to no purpose.” The
reader will observe that this dissipation, six weeks of
insobriety, is alleged to have occurred after Keats<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
“began to despond.” The precise time when he began
to despond is not defined, but we may suppose it to have
been in the late autumn of 1818. If so, it was much
about the same period when he first made Miss Brawne's
acquaintance.</p>

<p>It is true that Mr. Cowden Clarke, when he published
certain “Recollections” in <i>The Gentleman’s Magazine</i> in
1874, strongly contested these statements of Haydon’s;
he disbelieved the cayenne pepper and the dissipation,
and had “never perceived in Keats even a tendency to
imprudent indulgence.” The “Recollections” were
afterwards reproduced as a volume, and in the volume
the confutation of Haydon disappeared; whether because
Clarke had eventually changed his opinion, or for what
other reason, I am unable to say. Anyhow, Haydon’s
evidence remains; it relates to a period of Keats’s life
when Haydon no doubt saw him much oftener than
Clarke did, and we must observe that he refers to
“Keats’s own expression” as to the claret ensuing after
the cayenne pepper, and affirms that he himself remonstrated
in vain against the “dissipation,” which means
apparently excess in drinking alone.</p>

<p>To advert to what Lord Byron wrote about Keats as
having been killed by <i>The Quarterly Review</i> is hardly
worth while. His first reference to the subject is in a
letter to Mr. Murray (publisher of <i>The Quarterly</i>) dated
April 26, 1821. In this he expressly names Shelley as
his informant, and with Shelley as an authority for the
allegation I have already dealt.</p>

<p>There are two writings of Leigh Hunt in which the
question of Keats and his critics is touched upon. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
first is the review, August 1820, of the “Lamia” volume.
In speaking of the “Ode to a Nightingale” he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“The poem will be the more striking to the reader when
he understands, what we take a friend’s liberty in telling
him, that the author’s powerful mind has for some time
past been inhabiting a sickened and shaken body; and
that in the meanwhile it has had to contend with feelings
that make a fine nature ache for its species, even when
it would disdain to do so for itself&mdash;we mean critical
malignity, that unhappy envy which would wreak its own
tortures upon others, especially upon those that really feel
for it already.”</p></div>

<p>Hunt’s posthumous Memoir of Keats was first published
in 1828. He refers to the attack in <i>Blackwood</i>
upon himself and upon Keats, and says: “I little suspected,
as I did afterwards, that the hunters had struck
him; that a delicate organization, which already anticipated
a premature death, made him feel his ambition
thwarted by these fellows; and that the very impatience
of being impatient was resented by him and preyed on
his mind.” Hunt also says regarding Byron&mdash;“I told
him he was mistaken in attributing Keats’s death to the
critics, though they had perhaps hastened and certainly
embittered it.”</p>

<p>Another item of evidence may be cited. It is from a
letter written by George Keats to Mr. Dilke in April
1824, and refers to the insolences of <i>Blackwood’s
Magazine</i>. George, it will be remembered, was already
out of England before the articles appeared in <i>Blackwood</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
and in <i>The Quarterly</i>, and he only saw a little of John
Keats at the close of the ensuing year, 1819. “<i>Blackwood’s
Magazine</i> has fallen into my hands. I could
have walked 100 miles to have dirked him <i>à l’Américaine</i>
for his cruelly associating John in the Cockney
School, and other blackguardisms. Such paltry ridicule
will have wounded deeper than the severest criticisms,
particularly as he regarded what is called the cockneyism
of the coterie with so much disgust. He either knew
John well, and touched him in the tenderest place purposely;
or knew nothing of him, and supposed he went
all lengths with the set in their festering opinions and
cockney affectations.” And from a later letter dated in
April 1825: “After all, <i>Blackwood</i> and <i>The Quarterly</i>,
associated with our family disease, consumption, were
ministers of death sufficiently venomous, cruel, and
deadly, to have consigned one of less sensibility to a
premature grave.... John was the very soul of courage
and manliness, and as much like the Holy Ghost as
‘Johnny Keats.’”</p>

<p>The evidence of latest date on this subject (there is
none such in Severn’s correspondence<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>) is that of
Cowden Clarke. In his “Recollections,” already mentioned,
he refers to the attacks upon Keats, having his
eye, it would seem, rather upon those in <i>Blackwood</i> than
in <i>The Quarterly</i>, and he remarks: “To say that these
disgusting misrepresentations did not affect the conscious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>ness
and self-respect of Keats would be to under-rate the
sensitiveness of his nature. He did feel and resent the
insult, but far more the <i>injustice</i> of the treatment he had
received. They no doubt had injured him in the most
wanton manner; but, if they or my Lord Byron ever for
one moment supposed that he was crushed or even cowed
in spirit by the treatment he had received, never were
they more deluded.”</p>

<p>I have now given all the evidence at first or second
hand which seems to be producible on that much-vexed
question&mdash;Was Keats (to adopt Byron’s phrase) “snuffed
out by an article"? The upshot appears to me to be as
follows. In his inmost mind Keats was from first to last
raised very far above that level where the petty gales of
review-criticism blow, puffing out the canvas of feeble
reputations, and fraying that of strong ones. Nevertheless
he was sensitive to derisive criticism, and more especially
to personal ridicule, and even (as Haydon records) gave
way to his feelings of irritation with reckless and culpable
self-abandonment. This passed off partially, and would
have passed off entirely&mdash;it has left in his letters no trace
worth mentioning, and in his poetry no trace at all, other
than that of executive power braced up to do constantly
better and yet better; but then, about a year and a
half after the reviews, supervened his fatal illness (which
cannot be reasonably supposed to have had its root in
any critiques), and all the heartache of his unsatisfied
love. This last formed the real agony of his waning life:
it must have been reinforced to some extent by resentment
against a mode of reviewing which would contribute
to the thwarting of his poetic ambition, and make him go<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
down into the grave with a “name writ in water;” but the
reviews themselves counted for very little in the last
wrestlings of his spirit with death and nothingness. By
general constitution of mind few men were less adapted
than Keats for being “snuffed out by an article,” or
more certain to snuff one out and leave all its ill-savour
to its scribe.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI.</h2>


<p>The first important poem to which Keats sets his
hand after finishing “Endymion” was “Isabella,
or The Pot of Basil.” This was completed by April
27, 1818, the same month in which “Endymion” was
published. Hamilton Reynolds had suggested the project
of producing a volume of tales in verse, founded
upon stories in Boccaccio’s “Decameron”; some of the
tales would have been executed by Reynolds himself,
who did in fact produce on this plan the two poems
named collectively “The Garden of Florence.” As it
turned out, however, Keats’s tale appeared in a volume of
his own, 1820, and Reynolds’s two came out independently
in the succeeding year.</p>

<p>“The Eve of St. Agnes” was written in the winter
beginning the year 1819. Then came “Hyperion,” of
which two versions remain, both fragmentary. The first
version (begun perhaps as early as October or September
1818), the only one which Keats himself published, is
in all respects by far the better. He was much under
the spell of Milton while he wrote it; and finally he
gave it up in September 1819, declaring that “there
were too many Miltonic inversions in it.” He went so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
far as to say in a letter written in the same month that
“the ‘Paradise Lost,’ though so fine in itself, is a corruption
of our language&mdash;a northern dialect accommodating
itself to Greek and Latin inversions and
intonations.” “Hyperion” was included in Keats’s
third volume at the request of the publishers, contrary
to the author’s own preference. One may readily infer
that it was to “Hyperion” that he referred when, in the
preface to “Endymion,” he spoke of returning to
Grecian mythology for another subject: the full length
of the poem was to have been ten books.</p>

<p>“Lamia” was the last poem of considerable length
which Keats brought to completion and published. It
seems to have been begun towards the summer of 1819,
and was written with great care, after a heedful study of
Dryden’s methods of composition. On September 18,
1819, Keats wrote: “I am certain there is that sort of
fire in it which must take hold of people in some way,
give them either pleasant or unpleasant sensations.” The
subject was taken from Burton’s “Anatomy of Melancholy,”
in which there is a reference to the “Life of
Apollonius” by Philostratus as the original source of the
legend.</p>

<p>The volume&mdash;entitled “Lamia, Isabella, The Eve of
St. Agnes, and other Poems”&mdash;came out towards the
beginning of July 1820, when the malady of Keats had
reached an advanced and alarming stage. At the beginning
of September Keats wrote to Brown&mdash;“The sale
of my book is very slow, though it has been very highly
rated.” I am not aware that there is any other record
to show how far the publication may ultimately have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
approached towards becoming a commercial success; nor
indeed would it be altogether easy to define the date at
which Keats became a recognized and uncontested poet
of high rank, and his works a solid property. His early
death, at the beginning of 1821, must have formed a
turning-point&mdash;not to speak of the favourable notice of
“Endymion,” and subordinately of the “Lamia” volume,
which appeared in <i>The Edinburgh Review</i>, Jeffrey being
the critic, in August 1820. Perhaps Jeffrey’s praise
may have facilitated an arrangement which Keats made
in September 1820&mdash;the sale of the copyright of
“Endymion” to Messrs. Taylor and Hessey for £100;
no second edition of the poem appeared, however, while
he was alive. I should presume that, within five or six
years after Keats’s decease, ridicule and rancour were
already much in the minority; and that, by some such
date as 1835 to 1840, they had finally “hidden their
diminished heads,” living only, with too persistent a life,
in the retributive memory of men.</p>

<p>Some of the shorter poems in the “Lamia” volume
must receive brief mention here. The “Ode to Psyche”
was written in February 1819, and was termed by Keats
the first poem with which he had taken pains&mdash;“I have
for the most part dashed off my lines in a hurry.” “To
Autumn,” the “Ode on Melancholy,” and the “Ode on
a Grecian Urn,” succeeded. The “Ode to a Nightingale”
was composed at Hampstead in the spring of
1819 <i>after breakfast</i>, forming two or three hours’ work:
thus we see that the nocturnal imagery of the ode was a
general or a particular reminiscence, not actual to the
very moment of composition. This poem and the “Ode<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
on a Grecian Urn” were recited by Keats to Haydon in
a chaunting tone in Kilburn meadows, and were published
in the serial entitled “Annals of the Fine Arts.” The
urn thus immortalized may probably be one preserved in
the garden of Holland House.</p>

<p>With the “Lamia” volume we have come to the close
of what Keats published during his lifetime. Something
remains to be said of other writings of his&mdash;almost all of
them earlier in date than the publication of that volume&mdash;which
remained imprinted or uncollected at the time
of his death.</p>

<p>In <a name="Page_110t" id="Page_110t"></a><a href="#Page_110tn">February</a> 1818 Keats, Leigh Hunt, and Shelley,
undertook to write a sonnet each upon the river Nile.
In order of merit, the three sonnets are the reverse of
what one might have been willing to forecast. I at
least am clearly of opinion that Hunt’s sonnet is the
best (though with a weak ending), Keats’s the second,
and Shelley’s a decidedly bad third. The leading
thought in each sonnet is characteristic of its author.
Keats adheres to the simple natural facts of the case,
while Hunt and Shelley turn the Nile into a moral or
intellectual symbol. Keats says essentially that to associate
the Nile with ideas of antique desolation is but a
delusion of ignorance, for this river is really rich and fresh
like others. Hunt makes the Egyptian stream an emblem
of history tending towards the progress of the individual
and the race; while Shelley reads into the Nile a lesson
of the good and the evil inhering in knowledge.</p>

<p>“The Eve of St. Mark”&mdash;a fragment which very few of
Keats’s completed poems can rival in point of artist-like
feeling and writing&mdash;belongs to the years 1818&ndash;9. I find<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
nothing in print to account for his leaving it unfinished.</p>

<p>In May 1819 Keats had an idea of inventing a new
structure of sonnet-rhyme; and he sent to his brother
and sister-in-law a sonnet composed accordingly, beginning&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“If by dull rhymes our English must be chained.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He wrote: “I have been endeavouring to discover a
better sonnet-stanza than we have. The legitimate does
not suit the language well, from the pouncing rhymes.
The other appears too elegiac, and the couplet at the
end of it has seldom a pleasing effect. I do not pretend
to have succeeded.” Keats’s experiment reads agreeably.
It comprises five rhymes altogether; the first
rhyme being repeated thrice at arbitrary intervals; and
the last rhyme twice in lines twelve and fourteen.</p>

<p>The tragedy of “Otho the Great” was written by
Keats (as already referred to) in July and August 1819,
in co-operation with Armitage Brown. The diction of
the play is, it would appear, Keats’s entirely; whereas
the invention and development of plot in the first four acts
is wholly due to Brown. The two friends sat together;
Brown described each successive scene, and Keats
turned it into verse, without troubling his head as to
the subject-matter for the scene next ensuing. When it
came to the fifth act, however, Keats inquired what
would be the conclusion of the play; and, not being
satisfied with Brown’s project which he deemed too
humorous and too melodramatic, he both invented and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
wrote a fifth act for himself. He felt sure that “Otho
the Great” was “a tolerable tragedy,” and set his heart
upon getting it acted&mdash;Kean was well inclined to take
the principal character, Prince Ludolph; and it became
his greatest ambition to write fine plays. “Otho” was
in fact accepted for Drury Lane Theatre, on the offer of
Brown, who left Keats’s authorship in the background;
but, as both the writers were impatient of delay, Brown,
in February 1820, took away the MS., and Covent
Garden Theatre was thought of instead&mdash;without any
practical result. As soon as “Otho” was finished,
Brown suggested King Stephen as the subject of another
drama; and Keats, without any further collaboration
from his friend, composed the few scenes of it which
remain. “One of my ambitions” (writes Keats to
Bailey in August 1819), “is to make as great a revolution
in modern dramatic writing as Kean has done in
acting.”</p>

<p>The ballad “La Belle Dame sans Merci,” than which
Keats did nothing more thrilling or more perfect, may
perhaps have been written in the earlier half of 1819; it
was published in 1820, in Hunt’s <i>Indicator</i> for May
10th, under the signature “Caviare”; the same signature
which was adopted for the sonnet, “A dream, after
reading Dante’s episode of Paolo and Francesca.” Keats
may probably have meant to imply, in some bitterness of
spirit, that his poems were “caviare to the general.”
The title of this ballad was suggested to Keats by seeing
it at the head of a translation from Alain Chartier in a
copy of Chaucer. As to the “Dream” sonnet he wrote
in April 1819:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“The 5th canto of Dante pleases me more, and more;
it is that one in which he meets with Paulo and Francesca.
I had passed many days in rather a low state of
mind, and in the midst of them I dreamt of being in
that region of Hell. The dream was one of the most
delightful enjoyments I ever had in my life. I floated
about the wheeling atmosphere, as it is described,
with a beautiful figure, to whose lips mine were joined,
it seemed for an age; and in the midst of all this cold
and darkness I was warm. Ever-flowery tree-tops sprang
up, and we rested on them, sometimes with the lightness
of a cloud, till the wind blew us away again. I tried a
sonnet on it; there are fourteen lines in it, but nothing
of what I felt. Oh that I could dream it every night!”</p></div>

<p>The last long work which Keats undertook, and he
wrote it with extreme facility, was “The Cap and Bells;
or The Jealousies, a Fairy Tale,” in the Spenserian stanza.
What remains is probably far less than Keats intended
the tale to amount to, but it is enough to enable us to
pronounce upon its merits. The poem was begun soon
after Keats’s first attack of blood-spitting in February
1820. It seems singular that under such depressing
conditions he should have written in so frivolous and
jaunty a spirit, and provoking that his last long work
(the last, that is, if we except the recast of “Hyperion”)
should be about the most valueless which he produced,
at any date after commencing upon “Endymion.” This
poem has been said to be written in the spirit of
Ariosto; a statement which, in justice to the brilliant
Italian, cannot be admitted. It may well be, however,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
as Lord Houghton suggests, that the general notion was
suggested by Brown, who had translated the first five
cantos (not indeed of Ariosto, but) of the “Orlando
Innamorato” of Bojardo. “The Cap and Bells”
appears to be destitute of distinct plan, though some
sort of satirical allusion to the marital and extra-marital
exploits of George IV. is traceable in it; meagre and
purposeless in invention; a poor farrago of pumped-up
and straggling jocosity. Perhaps a hearty laugh has
never been got out of it; although there are points here
and there at which a faint snigger may be permissible,
and the concluding portion improves somewhat. Keats
seems to have intended to publish it under a pseudonym,
Lucy Vaughan Lloyd; and Hunt gave, in <i>The Indicator</i>
of August 23, 1820, some taste of its quality,
possibly meaning to print more of it anon.</p>

<p>The last verses which Keats ever wrote formed the
sonnet here ensuing. He composed this late in September
1820, after landing on the Dorsetshire coast,
probably near Lulworth, and returning to the ship which
bore him to his doom in Italy; and he wrote it down on
a blank page in Shakespeare’s Poems, facing “A

<p>Of poetic projects which remained unfulfilled when
Keats died we hear&mdash;leaving out of count the works
which he had begun and left uncompleted&mdash;of only one.
During his voyage to Naples he often spoke of wishing
to write the story of Sabrina, as indicated in Milton’s
“Comus,” connecting it with some points in English
history and character.</p>

<p>In prose&mdash;apart from his letters, which are noticeably
various in mood, matter, and manner, and contain many
admirable things&mdash;Keats wrote extremely little. In a
weekly paper with which Reynolds was connected, <i>The
Champion</i>, December 1817, he published two articles
on “Kean as a Shakespearean Actor:” they are not
remarkable. With the above-named articles are now
associated some “Notes on Shakespeare,” not written
with a view to publication; these appear to me somewhat
strained and bloated. There are also some “Notes
on Milton’s ‘Paradise Lost.’” On September 22, 1819,
Keats addressed to Mr. Dilke a letter, which however
does not appear to have been actually sent off. As it
shows a definite intention of writing in prose for regular
publication and for an income, a few sentences are worth
quoting.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot"><p>“It concerns a resolution I have taken to endeavour
to acquire something by temporary writing in periodical
works. You must agree with me how unwise it is to
keep feeding upon hopes which, depending so much on
the state of temper and imagination, appear gloomy or
bright, near or afar off, just as it happens.... You may
say I want tact; that is easily acquired.... I should, a
year or two ago, have spoken my mind on every subject
with the utmost simplicity. I hope I have learned a
little better, and am confident I shall be able to cheat as
well as any literary Jew of the market, and shine up an
article on anything without much knowledge of the
subject&mdash;aye, like an orange. I would willingly have
recourse to other means. I cannot; I am fit for nothing
but literature.... Notwithstanding my ‘aristocratic’
temper, I cannot help being very much pleased with the
present public proceedings. I hope sincerely I shall be
able to put a mite of help to the liberal side of the
question before I die.”</p></div>

<p>On the following day Keats wrote to Brown on the
same subject&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“I will write on the liberal side of the question for
whoever will pay me. I have not known yet what it is to
be diligent. I purpose living in town in a cheap lodging,
and endeavouring, for a beginning, to get the theatricals
of some paper.... I shall apply to Hazlitt, who knows
the market as well as any one, for something to bring me
in a few pounds as soon as possible. I shall not suffer
my pride to hinder me. The whisper may go round&mdash;I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
shall not hear it. If I can get an article in <i>The
Edinburgh</i>, I will. One must not be delicate.”</p></div>

<p>In pursuance of this plan, Keats did, for a few days
in October, take a lodging in Westminster. He then
reverted to Hampstead, and finally the scheme came to
nothing, principally perhaps because his fatal illness
began, and everything had to be given up which was not
directly controlled by considerations of health.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII.</h2>


<p>Having now gone through the narrative of Keats’s
life and death, and also the narrative of his
literary work, we have before us the more delicate and
exacting task of forming some judgment of both,&mdash;to
estimate his character, and appraise his writings. But
first I pause a brief while for the purpose of relating a
little that took place after his decease, and mentioning a
few particulars regarding his surviving relatives and
friends.</p>

<p>Keats was buried in the Protestant Cemetery at Rome
amid the overgrown ruins of the Honorian walls, surmounted
by the pyramid-tomb of Caius Cestius, a
Tribune of the People whose monument has long survived
his fame: this used to be traditionally called the
Tomb of Remus. There were but few graves on the
spot when Keats was laid there. In recent years the
portion of the cemetery where he reposes has been cut off
by a fortification. A little altar-tomb was set up for him,
sculptured with a Greek lyre, and inscribed with his name
and his own epitaph, “Here lies one whose name was
writ in water.” Severn attended affectionately to all this,
and the whole was completed about two years after the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
poet’s death. In 1875 General Sir Vincent Eyre and
some other Englishmen and Americans repaired the
stone, and placed on an adjacent wall a medallion
portrait of Keats, presented by its sculptor, Mr. Warrington
Wood. Severn, who died in August 1879, having
been British Consul in Rome for many years, now lies
in close proximity to his friend. Shelley’s remains
are interred hard by, but in the new cemetery,&mdash;not the
old one, which received the bones of Keats. As early
as 1836 Severn was able to attest that his connection
with the poet had been of benefit to his own professional
career. The friend and death-bed companion of Keats
had by that time become a personage, apart from the
merit, be it greater or less, of his performances as a
painter.</p>

<p>Severn’s letters addressed to Armitage Brown show
that it was expected that Brown should write a Life of
Keats. The non-appearance of any such work was made
a matter of remonstrance in 1834; and at one time George
Keats, though conscious of not being quite the right man
for the purpose, thought of supplying the deficiency.
Severn also had had a similar idea. Brown was in Italy
in 1832, and there he met Mr. Richard Monckton Milnes,
afterwards Lord Houghton. He returned to England
some three years later, and was about to produce the
desired Life when a new project entered his mind, and he
emigrated to New Zealand. He then handed over to
Mr. Milnes all his collections of Keats’s writings, and the
biographical notices which he had compiled, and these
furnished a substantive basis for Mr. Milnes’s work published
in 1848&mdash;a work written with abundant sympathy,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
invaluable at its own date and ever since to all lovers of
the poet’s writings. Brown died towards 1842.</p>

<p>George Keats voluntarily paid all the debts left by his
brother. These have not been precisely detailed: but it
appears that Messrs. Taylor and Hessey had made an
advance of £150, and there must have been something
not inconsiderable due to Brown, and probably also to
Dilke, who assured George that John Keats had known
nothing of direct want of either money or friends. George,
who has been described as “the most manly and self-possessed
of men,” settled at Louisville, Kentucky, where
he became a prominent citizen, and left a family creditably
established. He died in 1841, and his widow
remarried with a Mr. Jeffrey. In one of his letters
addressed to his sister, April 1824, there is a pleasant
little critique of “Don Quixote.” It gives one so prepossessing
an idea of its writer that I am tempted to
extract it:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Your face is decidedly not Spanish, but English all
over. If I fancied you to resemble Don Quixote, I
should fancy a handsome, intelligent, melancholy countenance,
with something wild but benevolent about the
eyes, a lofty forehead but not very broad, with finely-arched
eyebrows, denoting candour and generosity. He
is an immense favourite of mine; and I cannot help
feeling angry with the great Cervantes for bringing him
into situations where he is the laughing-stock of minds
so inferior to his own. It is evident he was a great
favourite of the author, and it is evident <i>he</i> was united
with the chivalric spirits he so wittily ridicules. He is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
made to speak as much sound sense, elevated morality,
and true piety, as any divine who ever wrote. If I were
to meet such a man, I should almost hate myself for
laughing at his eccentricities.”</p></div>

<p>The opening reference here to a Spanish face must
relate to the fact that Miss Fanny Keats, who in girlhood
had been the recipient of many affectionate and attentive
letters from her brother John, was engaged to, and
eventually married, a Spanish gentleman, Senhor Llanos,
author of “Don Esteban,” “Sandoval the Freemason,”
and other books illustrating the modern history of his
country. He was a Liberal, and in the time of the
Spanish Republic represented his Government at the
Court of Rome. Mrs. Llanos is still living at a very
advanced age. A few years ago a pension on the Civil
List was conferred upon her, in national recognition of
what is due to the sister of John Keats. There is a
pathetic reference to her appearance at the close of the
very last letter which he wrote: “My sister, who walks
about my imagination like a ghost, she is so like Tom.”</p>

<p>Miss Brawne married a Mr. Lindon some years after
the death of Keats. I do not know how many years,
but it must have been later than June 1825. She died
in 1865.</p>

<p>The sincerity or otherwise of Leigh Hunt as a personal,
and more especially a literary, friend of Keats, has been
a good deal canvassed of late. It has been said that he
showed little staunchness in championing the cause of
Keats at the time&mdash;towards the close of 1818&mdash;when
detraction was most rampant, and when support from a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
man occupying the position of editor of <i>The Examiner</i>
would have been most serviceable. But one must not
hurry to assume that Hunt was seriously in the wrong,
whether we regard the question as one of individual
friendship or of literary policy. The attacks upon Keats
were in great measure flank-attacks upon Hunt himself.
Keats was abused on the ground that he wrote bad
poetry through imitating Hunt’s bad poetry&mdash;that he out-Heroded
Herod, or out-Hunted Hunt. Obviously it
was a delicate task which would have lain before the
elder poet: for any direct defence of Keats must have
been conducted on the thesis either that the faults were
not there (when indeed they <i>were</i> there to a large extent);
or else that the faults were in fact beauties, an allegation
which would only have riveted the charge that they were
Leigh-Huntish mannerisms; or finally that they were
not due to Hunt’s influence or example, but were proper
to Keats in person, and this would have been more in
the nature of censure than of vindication. A defence
on general grounds, upholding the poems without any
discussion of the particular faults alleged, would also, as
coming from Hunt, have been a difficult thing to manage:
it would rather have inflamed than abated the rancour of
the enemy. Besides, we must remember that Keats’s
first volume, though very warmly accepted and praised
by Hunt, was really but beginner’s work, imperfect in the
last degree; while the second volume, “Endymion,” was
viewed by Hunt as a hazardous and immature attempt
notwithstanding its many beauties, and incapable of
being upheld beyond a certain limit. There was not at
that date any third volume to be put forward in proof of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
faculty, or in arrest of judgment. Mr. Forman, than
whom no man looks with more patience into the evidence
on a question such as this of Hunt’s friendship, or is
more likely to pronounce a sound judgment upon it,
wholly scouts the accusation; and I am quite content to
range myself on the same side as Mr. Forman.</p>

<p>Of Keats’s friends in general it may be said that the
one whom he respected very highly in point of character
was Bailey: the one who had a degree of genius fully
worthy, whatever its limitations and defects, of communing
with his own, was Haydon. Shelley can hardly
be reckoned among his friends, though very willing and
even earnest to be such, both in life and after death.
Keats held visibly aloof from Shelley, more perhaps on
the ground of his being a man of some family and
position than from any other motive. Shortly after the
publication of “The Revolt of Islam,” Keats’s rather
naïve expression was, “Poor Shelley, I think he has his
quota of good qualities.” Neither did he show any
warm or frank admiration of Shelley’s poetry. On
receiving a copy of “The Cenci,” he urged its author to
“curb his magnanimity, and be more of an artist, and
load every rift of his subject with ore.” We should not
ascribe this to any mean-spirited jealousy, but to that
sense, which grew to a great degree of intensity in
Keats, that the art of composition and execution is of
paramount importance in poetry, and must supersede all
considerations of abstract or proselytizing intention.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>


<p>I must next proceed to offer some account of Keats’s
person, character, and turn of mind.</p>

<p>As I have already said, Keats was a very small man,
barely more than five feet in height. He was called
“Little Keats” by his surgical fellow-students. Archdeacon
Bailey has left a good description of him in brief:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“There was in the character of his countenance the
femineity which Coleridge thought to be the mental
constitution of true genius. His hair was beautiful, and,
if you placed your hand upon his head, the curls fell
round it like a rich plumage. I do not particularly
remember the thickness of the upper lip so generally
described; but the mouth was too wide, and out of harmony
with the rest of his face, which had a peculiar
sweetness of expression, with a character of mature
thought, and an almost painful sense of suffering.”</p></div>

<p>Leigh Hunt should also be heard:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“His lower limbs were small in comparison with the
upper, but neat and well-turned. His shoulders were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
very broad for his size. He had a face in which energy
and sensibility were remarkably mixed up&mdash;an eager
power checked and made impatient by ill-health. Every
feature was at once strongly cut and delicately alive.
If there was any faulty expression, it was in the mouth,
which was not without something of a character of
pugnacity. His face was rather long than otherwise.
The upper lip projected a little over the under; the chin
was bold, the cheeks sunken; the eyes mellow and
glowing&mdash;large, dark, and sensitive. At the recital of a
noble action or a beautiful thought, they would suffuse
with tears, and his mouth trembled. In this there was
ill-health as well as imagination, for he did not like these
betrayals of emotion; and he had great personal as well
as moral courage. His hair, of a brown colour, was fine,
and hung in natural ringlets. The head was a puzzle for
the phrenologists, being remarkably small in the skull; a
singularity which he had in common with Byron and
Shelley, whose hats I could not get on. Keats was
sensible of the disproportion above noticed between his
upper and lower extremities; and he would look at his
hand, which was faded, and swollen in the veins, and say
it was the hand of a man of fifty.”</p></div>

<p>Cowden Clarke confirms Hunt in stating that Keats’s
hair was brown, and he assigns the same colour, or dark
hazel, to his eyes: confuting the “auburn” and “blue”
of which Mrs. Procter had spoken. It is rather remarkable
that, while Hunt speaks of the projection of the
<i>upper</i> lip&mdash;a detail which is fully verified in a charcoal
drawing by Severn&mdash;Lord Houghton observes upon “the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
undue prominence of the <i>lower</i> lip,” which point I cannot
trace clearly in any one of the portraits. Keats himself,
in one of his love-letters (August 1819), says, “I do not
think myself a fright.” According to Clarke, John Keats
was the only one of the family who resembled the father
in person and feature, while the other three resembled
the mother. George Keats does not wholly coincide in
this, for he says, “My mother resembled John very much
in the face;” at the same time he would not have been
qualified to deny a likeness to the father, of whom he
remembered nothing except that he had dark hair. The
lady who saw Keats’s hair and eyes of the wrong colour
saw at any rate his face to some effect, having left it
recorded thus: “His countenance lives in my mind as
one of singular beauty and brightness; it had an expression
as if he had been looking on some glorious
sight.” In a like spirit, Haydon speaks of Keats as
having “an eye that had an inward look, perfectly
divine, like a Delphian priestess who saw visions.” His
voice was deep and grave.</p>

<p>Let us now turn to the portraits, which are as numerous
and as good as could fairly be expected under the circumstances.</p>

<p>The earliest in date, and certainly one of the best from
an art point of view, is a sketch in profile done by
Haydon preparatory to introducing Keats’s head into
the picture of Christ’s Entry into Jerusalem. The sketch
dates in November 1816, just after Keats had come of
age. The picture is in Philadelphia, and I cannot speak
of the head as it appears there. In the sketch we see
abundant wavy hair; a forehead and nose sloping forward<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
to the nasal tip in a nearly uniform curve; a dark, set,
speaking eye; a mouth tolerably well moulded, the upper
lip being fully long enough, and noticeably overhanging
the lower lip, upon which the chin&mdash;large, full, and
rounded&mdash;closely impinges. The whole face partakes
of the Raphaelesque cast of physiognomy. At some time,
which may have been the autumn of 1817, some one,
most probably Haydon, took a mask of the face of
Keats. In respect of actual form, this is necessarily the
final test of what the poet was like&mdash;but masks are often
only partially true to the <i>impression</i> of a face. This mask
confirms Haydon’s sketch markedly; allowing only for
the points that Haydon has rather emphasized the length
of the nose, and attenuated (so far as one can judge
from a profile) its thickness, and has given very much
more of the overhanging of the upper lip&mdash;but this last
would, by the very conditions of mask-taking, be there
reduced to a minimum. On the whole we may say that,
after considering reciprocally Haydon’s sketch and the
mask, we know very adequately what Keats’s face was&mdash;he
had ample reason for acquitting himself of being “a
fright.” We come still closer to a firm conclusion upon
taking into account, along with these two records, two
of the portraits left to us by Severn. One is a miniature,
which was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1819, and
which we may surmise to have been painted in that year,
or late in 1818: the well-known likeness which represents
Keats in three-quarters face, looking earnestly forwards,
and resting his chin upon his left hand. Here the eyes
are larger than in Haydon’s sketch, and the upper lip
shorter, while the forehead seems straighter; but, as to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
those matters of lip and forehead, a profile tells the plainer
tale. The whole aspect of the face is not greatly unlike
Byron’s. There is also the earlier charcoal drawing by
Severn, the best of all for enabling us to judge of the
beautiful rippling long hair; it is a profile, and extremely
like Haydon’s profile, except for the greater straightness
of the forehead, and the decided smallness of the chin,
points on which the mask shows conclusively that
Haydon was in the right. Most touching of all as a
reminiscence is the Indian-ink drawing which Severn
made of his dying friend on “28 Jan<span class="super">y.</span> 1821, 3 o’clock
morn<span class="super">g.</span>,” as he lay asleep, with the death-damp on his
dark hair. It exhibits the attenuation of disease, but
without absolute painfulness, and produces, fully as much
as any of the other portraits, the impression of a fine
and distinguished mould of face. Severn left yet other
likenesses of Keats&mdash;posthumous, and of inferior interest.
There is moreover a chalk drawing by the
painter Hilton, who used to meet Keats at the house
of the publisher Mr. Taylor. It has an artificial air, and
conveys a notion of the general character of the face
different from the other records, but may assist us
towards estimating what Keats was like about, or very
soon before, the commencement of his fatal illness.
Lastly, though the list of extant portraits is not even
thus exhausted, I mention the medallion by Girometti,
which is to all appearance a posthumous performance.
Its lines correspond pretty well with the profile sketch by
Haydon, while in character it assimilates more to Hilton’s
drawing. To me it seems of very little importance as a
document, but Hamilton Reynolds thought it the best<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
likeness of all. Mrs. Llanos was in favour of the mask;
Mr. Cowden Clarke, of the crayon drawing by Severn&mdash;which,
indeed, conveys a bright impression of eager,
youthful impulsiveness.</p>

<p>The character of Keats appears to me not a very easy
one to expound. To begin with, it stands to reason that
a man who died at the age of twenty-five can only have
half evolved and evinced himself; there must have been
a great deal which time and trial, had these been granted,
would have developed, but which untimely fate left to conjecture.
We are thus compelled to judge of an apprentice
in the severe school of life as if he had gone through
its full course; many things about him may, in their real
nature, have been fleeting and tentative, which to us pass
for final and established. This difficulty has to be allowed
for, but cannot be got over; the only Keats with whom
we have to deal is the Keats who had not completed his
twenty-sixth year. For him, as for other youths, the tree
of the knowledge of good and evil had budded apace;
the fruit remained for ever unmatured. Another gravely
deflecting force in our estimation of the character of Keats
consists in the fact that what we really care for in him is
his poetry. We admire his poetry, and condole his inequitable
treatment, and his hard and premature fate,
and are disposed to see his life in the light of his verse
and his sufferings. Hence arises a facile and perhaps
vapid enthusiasm, with an inclination to praise through
thick and thin, or to ignore such points as may not be
susceptible of praise. The sympathetic biographer is a
very pleasant fellow; but the truthful biographer also has
something to say for himself in the long run. I aspire<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
to the part of the truthful biographer, duly sympathetic.</p>

<p>We have already seen that Keats in early childhood
was vehement and ungovernable. His sensibility displayed
itself in the strongest contrasts, and he would be
convulsed with laughter or with tears, rapidly interchanged.
At school his skill in bodily exercises, and
his marked generosity of spirit, made him very popular&mdash;his
comrades surmising that he would turn out superior
in some active career, such as soldiering. To be rated
as a good boy was not his ambition; but, as previously
stated, he settled down into a very attentive scholar.
Later on, his friend Bailey liked “the simplicity of his
character,” and his winning affectionate manner. “Simplicity”
means, I suppose, frankness or straightforwardness;
for I cannot see that Keats’s character was at any
time particularly simple&mdash;I should rather say that it was
complex and many-sided.</p>

<p>The one great craving of Keats, before the love for
Miss Brawne engrossed him, was the desire to become an
excellent poet; to do great things in poesy, and leave
a name among the immortals. At times he was conscious
of some presumption in this craving; but mostly
it seems to have held such plenary possession of him
that the question of presumption or otherwise hardly
arose. Whether he felt very strongly upon any matters
of intellectual or general concern other than poetic ones
may admit of some doubt. In Book II. of “Endymion”
he openly proclaims that poetic love-making is the one
thing needful to the susceptible mind; the Athenian
admiral and his auspicious owl, the Indian expeditions<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
of Alexander, Ulysses and the Cyclops, the death-day of
empires, are as nothing to Juliet’s passion, Hero’s tears,
Imogen’s swoon, and Pastorella in the bandits’ den.
He does indeed, in one of his letters (April 1818),
aver “I would jump down Ætna for any great public
good”; but it may perhaps be permissible to think that
he would at all events have postponed the Empedoclean
feat until he had written and ensured the publishing
of some poem upon which he could be content to stake
his claim to permanent poetic renown. His tension of
thought was great. In a letter which he addressed in
May 1817 to Leigh Hunt there is a little passage which
may be worth quoting here, along with Mr. Dilke’s comment
upon it:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“I went to the Isle of Wight. Thought so much about
poetry so long together that I could not get to sleep at
night; and moreover, I know not how it was, I could
not get wholesome food. By this means, in a week or
so, I became not over-capable in my upper stories, and
set off pell-mell for Margate, at least a hundred and fifty
miles, because forsooth I fancied that I should like my
old lodging here, and could continue to do without trees.
Another thing, I was too much in solitude, and consequently
was obliged to be in continual burning of
thought, as an only resource.”</p></div>

<p>This passage Mr. Dilke considered “an exact picture
of the man’s mind and character,” adding: “He could
at any time have ‘thought himself out,’ mind and body.
Thought was intense with him, and seemed at times to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
assume a reality that influenced his conduct, and, I have
no doubt, helped to wear him out.”</p>

<p>Whether Keats should be regarded as a young man
tolerably regular in his mode of life, or manifestly tending
to the irregular, is a question not entirely clear. We
have seen something of a sexual misadventure in Oxford,
and of six weeks of hard drinking, attested by Haydon;
and it should be added that two or three of Keats’s minor
poems have a certain unmistakable twang of erotic
laxity. Lord Houghton thought that in the winter of
1817&ndash;18 the poet had indulged somewhat “in that
dissipation which is the natural outlet for the young
energies of ardent temperaments;” but he held that it
all amounted to no more than “a little too much rollicking”
(Keats’s own phrase), and he would not allow that
either drinking or gaming had proceeded to any serious
extent, “for, in his letters to his brothers, he speaks of
having drunk too much as a rare piece of joviality, and
of having won £10 at cards as a great hit.” Medical
students, it may be added, are not, as a rule, conspicuous
for mortifying the flesh; Keats, however, according to
Mr. Stephens, did not indulge in any vice during his
term of studentship. He was eminently open, as his
writings evidence, to impressions of enjoyment; and one
may not unnaturally suppose that the joys of sense
numbered him, no less than the average of young men,
among their votaries&mdash;not indeed among their slaves.
He had not, I think, any taste for those “manly recreations”
which consist chiefly in making the lower animals
uncomfortable, or in putting a quietus to their comforts
and discomforts along with their lives. I only observe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
one occasion on which he went out with a gun. He
then (towards the close of 1818) accompanied Mr. Dilke
in shooting on Hampstead Heath, and his trophy was a
solitary tomtit.</p>

<p>As to strength or stability of character, it is rather
amusing to find Keats picking a hole in Haydon, while
Haydon could probe a joint in the armour of Keats. In
November 1817 Haydon had been playing rather fast
and loose (so at least it seemed to Keats and to his
friend Bailey) with a pictorial aspirant named Cripps, and
Keats wrote to Bailey in the following terms:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“To a man of your nature such a letter as Haydon’s
must have been extremely cutting.... As soon as I
had known Haydon three days, I had got enough of his
character not to have been surprised at such a letter as
he has hurt you with. Nor, when I knew it, was it a
principle with me to drop his acquaintance, although with
you it would have been an imperious feeling.... I
must say one thing that has pressed upon me lately, and
increased my humility and capability of submission, and
that is this truth: <i>Men of genius</i> are great as certain
ethereal chemicals operating on a mass of neutral
intellect; but they <i>have not any individuality, any determined
character</i>.”</p></div>

<p>The following also, from a letter of January 1818 to
the same correspondent, relates partly to Haydon:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“The sure way, Bailey, is first to know a man’s
faults, and then be passive. If after that he insensibly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
draws you towards him, then you have no power to
break the link.”</p></div>

<p>Haydon’s verdict upon Keats is no doubt extremely
important. I give here the whole entry in his diary,
29th of March 1821, omitting only two passages which
have been already extracted in their more essential
context:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Keats, too, is gone! He died at Rome, the 23rd
February, aged twenty-five. A genius more purely
poetical never existed. In fireside conversation he was
weak and inconsistent, but he was in his glory in the
fields. The humming of a bee, the sight of a flower, the
glitter of the sun, seemed to make his nature tremble;
then his eyes flashed, his cheeks glowed, his mouth
quivered. He was the most unselfish of human
creatures; unadapted to this world, he cared not for
himself, and put himself to any inconvenience for the
sake of his friends. He was haughty, and had a fierce
hatred of rank [this corresponds with Hunt’s remark,
that Keats looked upon a man of birth as his natural
enemy], but he had a kind, gentle heart, and would have
shared his fortune with any man who wanted it. His
classical knowledge was inconsiderable, but he could feel
the beauties of the classical writers. He had an exquisite
sense of humour, and too refined a notion of
female purity to bear the little sweet arts of love with
patience. <i>He had no decision of character</i>, and, having no
object upon which to direct his great powers, was at the
mercy of every pretty theory Hunt’s ingenuity might start.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
One day he was full of an epic poem; the next day epic
poems were splendid impositions on the world. Never for
two days did he know his own intentions.... The death
of his brother wounded him deeply, and it appeared to
me that he began to droop from that hour. I was much
attracted to Keats, and he had a fellow-feeling for me.
I was angry because he would not bend his great powers
to some definite object, and always told him so. Latterly
he grew irritated because I would shake my head at his
irregularities, and tell him that he would destroy himself....
Poor dear Keats! had nature given you
firmness as well as fineness of nerve, you would have
been glorious in your maturity as great in your promise.
May your kind and gentle spirit be now mingling with
those of Shakespeare and Milton, before whose minds
you have so often bowed! May you be considered
worthy of admission to share their musings in heaven,
as you were fit to comprehend their imaginations on
earth! Dear Keats, hail and adieu for some six or
seven years, and I shall meet you. I have enjoyed
Shakespeare more with Keats than with any other human
creature.”</p></div>

<p>In writing to Miss Mitford, Haydon added:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“His ruin was owing to <i>his want of decision of character,
and power of will</i>, without which genius is a
curse.”</p></div>

<p>It will be seen that Haydon’s character of Keats is in
some respects very highly laudatory: he speaks of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
poet’s unselfishness and generosity in terms which may
possibly run into excess, but cannot assuredly have fallen
short. What he remarks as to “irregularities” seems to
show that these had (at least in Haydon’s opinion) taken
somewhat firm root with Keats, and had not merely
come and gone with a spurt, as a relief from feelings of
depression or mortification; nor can we altogether forget
the statement that, on the night of February 3, 1820,
which closed with the first attack of blood-spitting, Keats
“returned home in a state of strange physical excitement&mdash;it
might have appeared to those who did not know
him one of fierce intoxication.” Physical excitement
which looks like fierce intoxication, without being really
anything of the sort, can be but a comparatively rare
phænomenon; nor do I suppose that an impending attack
of blood-spitting would account for such an appearance.
Brown, however, was still more positive than Lord
Houghton in excluding the idea of intoxication on that
occasion; he even says, “Such a state in him, I knew,
was impossible”&mdash;an assertion which we have to balance
against the general averments of Haydon. Keats’s
irritation at the remonstrances which Haydon addressed
to him upon irregularities, real or assumed, is mentioned
by the painter without any seeming knowledge of the
fact that Keats had (as shown by his letter of September
20, 1819, already cited, to his brother George)
cooled down very greatly in his cordiality to his monitor;
and he may perhaps have received the remonstrances in
a spirit of stubbornness, or of apparent irritation, more
because he was out of humour with Haydon than
because he could not confute the allegations, had he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
been so minded. As to the charge of want of decision
of character, want of power of will, we must try to understand
what is the exact sense in which Haydon applies
these terms. He appears from the context to refer
more to indefiniteness of literary aim, combined with
sensitiveness to critical detraction and ridicule, than to
anything really affecting the basis of a man’s character in
his general walk of life and commerce with the world.
A few words on both these aspects of the question will
not be wasted. We need not, however, recur to the
allegation of over-sensitiveness to criticism, or of being
“snuffed out by an article,” which has already been
sufficiently debated.</p>

<p>Indefiniteness of literary aim must be assessed in relation
to a man’s faculties, and in especial to his age and
experience. A beginner is naturally indefinite in aim, in
the sense that he tries his hand at various things, and
only after making several experiments does he learn
which things he can manage well, and which less than
well. Keats, in his first two volumes, was but a beginner,
and a youthful beginner. If they show indefiniteness of
aim&mdash;though indeed they hardly <i>do</i> show that in any
marked degree&mdash;one cannot regard the fact as derogatory
to the author. With his third volume, he was getting
some assurance of the direction in which his power lay.
It is certainly true that, after producing one epic (if such
it can be called), “Endymion,” and after commencing
another, “Hyperion,” he laid the second aside, for whatever
reason; partly, it would seem, because the harsh
reception of “Endymion” discouraged him, and partly
because he considered the turn of diction too obviously<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
Miltonic; and no doubt, as his mood varied, he must
have expressed to Haydon very divergent opinions as to
the expediency of writing epics. But, apart from this
special matter, the third volume shows no uncertainty
or infirmity of purpose. It contains three narrative
poems&mdash;“Isabella,” “The Eve of St. Agnes,” and
“Lamia”&mdash;some odes, and a few minor lyrics. The
very fact that he continued writing poetry so persistently,
maugre <i>Blackwood’s Magazine</i> and <i>The Quarterly Review</i>,
speaks to some decision of character and power of will
in literary matters; and the immense advance in executive
force tells the same tale aboundingly. Therefore,
while laying great stress upon Haydon’s view so far as it
concerns certain shifting currents of thought and of talk,
I cannot find that Keats is fairly open to the charge of
want of decision or of will in the literary relation. Then
as to the larger question of his character generally,
Keats appears to me to have been eminently wilful, and
somewhat wayward to boot. He had the temperament
of a man of genius, liable to sudden and sharp impressions,
and apt to go considerable lengths at the beck of
an impulse, or even of a caprice. Wilfulness along with
waywardness is certainly not quite the same thing as
“power of will,” but it testifies to a will which can exert
itself steadily if it likes. The very short duration of
Keats’s life, and the painful conjuncture of circumstances
which made his last year a despairing struggle between a
passionate love and an inexorable disease, preclude our
forming a very distinct opinion of what his power of will
might naturally have become. If I may venture a surmise,
I would say that he had within him the stuff of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
ample determination and high-heartedness in any matters
upon which he was in earnest, mingled however with
deficient self-control, and with a perilous facility for seeing
the seamy side of life.</p>

<p>Lord Houghton gives an attractive picture of Keats
at what was probably his happiest time, the winter of
1817-18, when “Endymion” was preparing for the
press. I cannot condense it to any purpose, and
certainly cannot improve it, so I reproduce the passage
as it stands:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Keats passed the winter of 1817-18 at Hampstead,
gaily enough among his friends. His society was much
sought after, from the delightful combination of earnestness
and pleasantry which distinguished his intercourse
with all men. There was no effort about him to say fine
things, but he <i>did</i> say them most effectively, and they
gained considerably by his happy transition of manner.
He joked well or ill as it happened, and with a laugh
which still echoes sweetly in many ears; but at the mention
of oppression or wrong, or at any calumny against
those he loved, he rose into grave manliness at once,
and seemed like a tall man. His habitual gentleness
made his occasional looks of indignation almost terrible.
On one occasion, when a gross falsehood respecting the
young artist, Severn, was repeated and dwelt upon, he
left the room, declaring ‘he should be ashamed to sit
with men who could utter and believe such things.’”</p></div>

<p>Severn himself avers that Keats never spoke of any
one unless by way of saying something in his favour.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>Cowden Clarke’s anecdote tells in the same direction,
that once, when some local tyranny was being discussed,
Keats amused the party by shouting: “Why is there not
a human dust-hole into which to tumble such fellows?”
His own Carlylean phrase seems to have tickled Keats
as well as others, for he repeated it in a field walk with
Haydon: “Haydon, what a pity it is there is not a
human dust-hole!”</p>

<p>To this may be added a few words from a letter addressed
from Teignmouth by Keats to Mr. Taylor in
April 1818:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“I know nothing, I have read nothing: and I mean
to follow Solomon’s directions, ‘Get learning, get understanding.’
I find earlier days are gone by; I find that I
can have no enjoyment in the world but continual drinking
of knowledge. I find there is no worthy pursuit but
the idea of doing some good to the world. Some do it
with their society, some with their wit, some with their
benevolence, some with a sort of power of conferring
pleasure and good humour on all they meet&mdash;and in a
thousand ways, all dutiful to the command of great
Nature. There is but one way for me: the road lies
through application, study, and thought. I will pursue
it; and for that end purpose retiring for some years. I
have been hovering for some time between an exquisite
sense of the luxurious and a love for philosophy. Were
I calculated for the former, I should be glad; but, as I am
not, I shall turn all my soul to the latter.”</p></div>

<p>This “exquisite sense of the luxurious” must have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
prompted an interjection of Keats in a rather earlier
letter to Bailey (November 1817): “Oh for a life of
sensations rather than of thoughts!”</p>

<p>One does not usually associate the suspicious character
with the unselfish and generous character. Even apart
from Haydon’s, there is ample evidence to show that
Keats was generous, and, in a sense, unselfish; although
a man of creative or productive genius, intent upon his
own work, and subordinating everything else to it, is
seldom unselfish in the fullest ordinary sense of the term.
But he was certainly suspicious. Of this temper we have
already seen some painful ebullitions in his letters to
Fanny Brawne. These might be ascribed mainly to the
acute feelings of a lover, the morbid impressions of an
invalid. But, in truth, Keats always was and had been
suspicious. In a letter to his brothers, dated in January
1818, he refers, in a tone of some soreness, to objections
which Hunt had raised against points of treatment in the
first Book of “Endymion,” adding: “The fact is, he and
Shelley are hurt, and perhaps justly, at my not having
showed them the affair officiously; and, from several
hints I have had, they appear much disposed to dissect
and anatomize any trip or slip I may have made.” Still
earlier, writing to Haydon, he had confessed to “a
horrid morbidity of temperament.” In a letter of June
1818 to Bailey he says: “You have all your life (I
think so) believed everybody: I have suspected everybody.”
By January 1820 he has got into a condition
of decided <i>ennui</i>, not far removed from misanthropy,
and the company of acquaintances, and even of friends,
is a tedium to him. This was a month before the begin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>ning
of his fatal illness. It is true, he was then in love.
He writes to Mrs. George Keats:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“I dislike mankind in general.... The worst of men
are those whose self-interests are their passions; the
next, those whose passions are their self-interest. Upon
the whole, I dislike mankind. Whatever people on the
other side of the question may advance, they cannot deny
that we are always surprised at hearing of a good action,
and never of a bad one.... If you were in England,
I dare say you would be able to pick out more amusement
from society than I am able to do. To me it is as
dull as Louisville is to you. [Then follow several
remarks on Hunt, Haydon, the Misses Reynolds, and
Dilke.] ’Tis best to remain aloof from people, and like
their good parts, without being eternally troubled with the
dull processes of their everyday lives. When once a
person has smoked the vapidness of the routine of
society, he must have either some self-interest or the love
of some sort of distinction to keep him in good humour
with it. All I can say is that, standing at Charing Cross,
and looking east, west, north, and south, I see nothing
but dulness.”</p></div>

<p>“I carry all things to an extreme,” he had written to
Bailey in July 1818, “so that when I have any little
vexation it grows in five minutes into a theme fit for
Sophocles. Then and in that temper if I write to any
friend, I have so little self-possession that I give him
matter for grieving, at the very time perhaps when I am
laughing at a pun.” A phrase which Keats used in a
letter of the 24th of October 1820, addressed to Mrs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
Brawne, may also be, in the main, a true item of self-portraiture:
“If ever there was a person born without
the faculty of hoping, I am he.” Too much weight,
however, should not be given to this, as the poet’s
disease had then brought him far onward towards his
grave. Severn does not seem to have regarded such a
tendency as innate in Keats, for he wrote, at a far later
date, “No mind was ever more exultant in youthful
feeling.”</p>

<p>Keats’s sentiment towards women appears to have been
that of a shy youth who was at the same time a critical
man. Miss Brawne enslaved him, but did not inspire
him with that tender and boundless confidence which
the accepted and engaged lover of a virtuous girl naturally
feels. With one woman, Miss Cox, he seems to
have been thoroughly at his ease; and one can gather
from his expressions that this unusual result depended
upon a fair counterbalance of claims. While she was
self-centred in her beauty and attractiveness, he was self-centred
in his intellect and aspirations. There is an
early poem of his&mdash;the reverse of a good one&mdash;which
seems worth quoting here. I presume he may have
been in his twenty-first year or so when he wrote it:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Woman, when I behold thee flippant, vain,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>From the opening lines of this poem I gather that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
Keats, when he wrote it, had never been in love; but
that he had a feeling towards pure, sweet-minded, lovely
women, which made him, in idea, their champion and
votary. Later on, in June 1818, he wrote to Bailey
that his love for his brothers had “always stifled the impression
that any woman might otherwise have made
upon him.” And in July of the same year, also to
Bailey:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“I am certain that our fair friends [<i>i.e.</i> the Misses
Reynolds] are glad I should come for the mere sake of
my coming; but I am certain I bring with me a vexation
they are better without.... I am certain I have not a
right feeling towards women: at this moment I am
striving to be just to them, but I cannot. Is it because
they fall so far beneath my boyish imagination? When
I was a schoolboy I thought a fair woman a pure
goddess; my mind was a soft nest in which some one of
them slept, though she knew it not. I have no right to
expect more than their reality. I thought them ethereal&mdash;above
men; I find them perhaps equal&mdash;great by comparison
is very small. Insult may be inflicted in more
ways than by word or action. One who is tender of
being insulted does not like to <i>think</i> an insult against
another. I do not like to think insults in a lady’s
company; I commit a crime with her which absence
would not have known.... When I am among women
I have evil thoughts, malice, spleen; I cannot speak or
be silent; I am full of suspicions, and therefore listen
to nothing; I am in a hurry to be gone. You must be
charitable, and put all this perversity to my being dis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>appointed
since my boyhood.... After all, I do think
better of womankind than to suppose they care whether
Mister John Keats, five feet high, likes them or not.”</p></div>

<p>In his letter about Miss Cox as “Charmian,” written
perhaps just before he knew Miss Brawne, Keats said:
“I hope I shall never marry.... The mighty abstract
idea of Beauty in all things I have stifles the more
divided and minute domestic happiness. An amiable
wife and sweet children I contemplate as part of that
Beauty, but I must have a thousand of those beautiful
particles to fill up my heart.... These things, combined
with the opinion I have formed of the generality of
women, who appear to me as children to whom I would
rather give a sugar-plum than my time, form a barrier
against matrimony which I rejoice in.”</p>

<p>We have seen, in one of Keats’s letters to Miss
Brawne, that he shrank from the thought of having their
mutual love made known to any of their friends. But
he went further than this. As well after as before he
had fallen in love with Miss Brawne, and had become
engaged to her, he could express a contrary state of
feeling. Thus, in addressing Mr. Taylor, on August 23,
1819, he says: “I equally dislike the favour of the public
with the love of a woman; they are both a cloying
treacle to the wings of independence.” And to his
brother George, September 17, 1819: “Nothing strikes
me so forcibly with a sense of the ridiculous as love. A
man in love, I do think, cuts the sorriest figure in the
world. Even when I know a poor fool to be really in
pain about it, I could burst out laughing in his face; his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
pathetic visage becomes irresistible.” The letters to
George, in fact, give no hint of any love for Miss Brawne,
still less of an engagement.</p>

<p>From all these details it would appear that Keats was
by no means an ardent devotee of the feminine type of
character. He thought there was but little congruity
between the Ideal and the Real of womanhood. He
parted company, in this regard, with Shakespeare and
Shelley, and adhered rather to Milton. So it was before
he was in love; and to be in love was not the occasion
of any essential alteration of view. He ascribed to
Fanny Brawne the same volatile appetite for amusement,
the same propensity for flirtation, the same comparative
shallowness of heart-affection, which he imputed to her
sex in general. He loved her passionately: he believed
in her not passionately, nor even intensely. That he
was hard hit by the blind and winged archer was a patent
fact; but he still knew the archer to be blind.</p>

<p>In a room, says Keats’s surgical fellow-student, Mr.
Stephens, he was always at the window peering out into
space, and it was customary to call the window-seat
“Keats’s place.” In his last illness he told Severn that
the intensest of his pleasures had been to watch the
growth of flowers; and, after lying quiet one day, he
whispered, “I feel the daisies [or “the flowers"] growing
over me.” In an early stage of his fatal illness,
February 16, 1820, he had written pathetically to James
Rice: “How astonishingly does the chance of leaving
the world impress a sense of its natural beauties upon
us! Like poor Falstaff, though I do not ‘babble,’ I
think of green fields; I muse with the greatest affection<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
on every flower I have known from my infancy&mdash;their
shapes and colours are as new to me as if I had just
created them with a superhuman fancy. It is because
they are connected with the most thoughtless and the
happiest moments of our lives. I have seen foreign
flowers in hot-houses, of the most beautiful nature, but
I do not care a straw for them. The simple flowers of
our spring are what I want to see again.” Music was
another of his great enjoyments. He would sit for hours
while Miss Charlotte Reynolds played to him on the
pianoforte; and a wrong note in an orchestra has been
known to rouse his pugnacity, and make him wish to
“go down and smash all the fiddles.” Haydn’s symphonies
were among his prime favourites, and Purcell’s
songs from Shakespeare. “Give me,” he wrote from
Winchester to his sister, in August 1819, “books, fruit,
French wine, and fine weather, and a little music out of
doors, played by somebody I do not know, and I can
pass a summer very quietly.” He would also listen long
to Severn’s playing, following the air with a low kind of
recitative; and could himself “produce a pleasing
musical effect, though possessing hardly any voice.”</p>

<p>Closely though he was mixed up with Leigh Hunt and
his circle, Keats had, in fact, not much sympathy with
their ideas on literary topics, nor with Hunt’s own
poetry, still less with their views on political matters of
the time, in which he took but very faint interest.
Cowden Clarke thought that the poet’s “whole civil
creed was comprised in the master-principle of universal
liberty, viz., equal and stern justice to all, from the duke
to the dustman.” He was, however, a liberal by tem<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>perament,
and, I suppose, by conviction as well. One
of the really puerile and nonsensical passages in
“Endymion” is that which opens book iii. He told
his friend Richard Woodhouse (a barrister, connected
with the firm of Taylor and Hessey) that it expressed
his opinion of the Tory Ministry then in office:&mdash;</p>

<p>A rather more sensible embodiment of his political
feelings is a stanza which he wrote, perhaps in 1818, at
the close of canto 5, book ii. of “The Faery Queen.” In
this stanza the revolutionary Giant, who had been suppressed
by Artegall and Talus, is represented as being
pieced together again by Typographus, the Printing-press,
and so trained up as to become more than a match
for his former victors. There is also, in a letter to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
George Keats dated in September 1819, a rather long
and detailed passage on politics covering a wide period
in English and European history, on the oscillations
of governmental and popular power &amp;c., and on the
writer’s sympathy with the enlightenment and progress
of the people. It closes with an admiring description
of Sandt, the assassin of Kotzebue, as pourtrayed in a
profile likeness. As to Hunt, some expressions in a
letter from George Keats to Dilke are decidedly strong:&mdash;“I
should be extremely sorry that poor John’s name
should go down to posterity associated with the littlenesses
of Leigh Hunt&mdash;an association of which he was
so impatient in his lifetime. He speaks of him patronizingly;
that he would have defended him against the
reviewers if he had known his nervous irritation at their
abuse of him, and says that on that point only he was
reserved to him. The fact was, he more dreaded Hunt’s
defence than their abuse. You know all this as well as
I do.”</p>

<p>Apart from his own special capability for poetry, Keats
had a mind both active and capacious. The depth,
pregnancy, and incisiveness, of many of the remarks in
his letters, glancing along a considerable range of subject-matter,
are highly noticeable. If some one were to take
the pains of extracting and classifying them, he would do
a good service to readers. It does not appear, however,
that Keats took much interest in any kind of knowledge
which could not be made applicable or subservient to the
purposes of poetry. Many will remember the <a name="Page_150t" id="Page_150t"></a><a href="#Page_150tn">anecdote</a>,
proper to Haydon’s “immortal dinner” (December
1817), of Keats’s joining with Charles Lamb in denounc<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>ing
Sir Isaac Newton for having destroyed all the poetry
of the rainbow by reducing it to the prismatic colours;
the whole company had to drink “Newton’s health, and
confusion to mathematics.” This was a freak, yet not so
mere a freak but that the poet&mdash;in one of his most
elaborated and heedful compositions, “Lamia”&mdash;could
revert to the same idea&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">“Do not all charms fly<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>In a letter to his brother, December 1817, Keats
observes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“The excellence of every art is its intensity, capable
of making all disagreeables evaporate from their being
in close relationship with beauty and truth. Examine
‘King Lear,’ and you will find this exemplified throughout....
It struck me what quality went to form a man of
achievement, especially in literature, and which Shakespeare
possessed so enormously. I mean <i>negative capability</i>;
that is, when a man is capable of being in
uncertainties, mysteries, doubts, without any irritable
reaching after fact and reason. Coleridge, for instance,
would let go by a fine isolated verisimilitude caught from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
the penetralium of mystery, from being incapable of
remaining content with half-knowledge. This, pursued
through volumes, would perhaps take us no further than
this: that with a great poet the sense of beauty overcomes
every other consideration, or rather obliterates all
consideration.”</p></div>

<p>Keats did not very often in his letters remark upon the
work of his poetic contemporaries. We have just read a
reference to Coleridge. In another letter addressed to
Haydon, January 1818, he shows that his admiration of
Wordsworth’s “Excursion” was great, coupling that poem
with Haydon’s pictures, and with “Hazlitt’s depth of
taste,” as “three things to rejoice at in this age.”</p>

<p>Soon afterwards, February 1818, while “Endymion”
was passing through the press, he wrote to Mr. Taylor:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“In poetry I have a few axioms, and you will see how
far I am from their centre. 1st, I think poetry should
surprise by a fine excess, and not by singularity; it
should strike the reader as a wording of his own highest
thoughts, and appear almost a remembrance. 2nd, Its
touches of beauty should never be half-way, thereby
making the reader breathless instead of content. The
rise, the progress, the setting, of imagery, should, like the
sun, come natural to him, shine over him, and set soberly
although in magnificence, leaving him in the luxury of
twilight. But it is easier to think what poetry should be
than to write it. And this leads me to another axiom&mdash;That,
if poetry comes not as naturally as the leaves to a
tree, it had better not come at all.”</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>Keats held that the melody of verse is founded on
the adroit management of open and close vowels. He
thought that vowels can be as skilfully combined and
interchanged as differing notes of music, and that monotony
should only be allowed when it subserves some
special purpose.</p>

<p>The following, from a letter to Mr. Woodhouse,
October 1818 (soon after the abusive reviews had appeared
in <i>Blackwood’s Magazine</i> and <i>The Quarterly</i>), is a
remarkable piece of self-analysis. As we read it, we
should bear in mind what Haydon said of Keats’s want
of decision of character. I am not indeed clear that
Keats has here pourtrayed himself with marked accuracy.
It may appear that he ascribes to himself too much of
absorption into the object or the personage which he
contemplates; whereas it might, with fully as much truth,
be advanced that he was wont to assimilate the personage
or the object to himself. I greatly doubt whether in
Keats’s poems we see the object or the personage the
clearer because his faculty transpires through them:
rather, we see the object or the personage through
the haze of Keats. His range was not extremely
extensive (whatever it might possibly have become, with
a longer lease of life), nor was his personality by any
means occulted. But in any event his statement here is
of great importance as showing what he thought of the
poetic phase of mind and working.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“As to the poetical character itself (I mean that sort
of which, if I am anything, I am a member&mdash;that sort
distinguished from the Wordsworthian or egotistical sub<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>lime,
which is a thing <i>per se</i>, and stands alone), it is not
itself&mdash;it has no self. It is everything, and nothing&mdash;it
has no character. It enjoys light, and shade. It lives in
gusto, be it foul or fair, high or low, rich or poor, mean
or elevated&mdash;it has as much delight in conceiving an Iago
as an Imogen. What shocks the virtuous philosopher
delights the chameleon poet. It does no harm from its
relish of the dark side of things, any more than from its
taste for the bright one, because they both end in speculation.
A poet is the most unpoetical of anything in
existence, because he has no identity: he is continually
in for, and filling, some other body. The sun, the moon,
the sea, and men and women who are creatures of impulse,
are poetical, and have about them an unchangeable
attribute: the poet has none, no identity. He is certainly
the most unpoetical of all God’s creatures. If
then he has no self, and if I am a poet, where is the
wonder that I should say I would write no more? Might
I not at that very instant have been cogitating on the
characters of Saturn and Ops? It is a wretched thing to
confess, but it is a very fact, that not one word I ever
utter can be taken for granted as an opinion growing out
of my identical nature. How can it when I have <i>no</i>
nature? When I am in a room with people, if I ever
am free from speculating on creations of my own brain,
then not myself goes home to myself, but the identity of
every one in the room begins to press upon me [so] that
I am in a very little time annihilated. Not only among
men; it would be the same in a nursery of children.”</p></div>

<p>Elsewhere Keats says, November 1817: “Nothing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
startles me beyond the moment. The setting sun will
always set me to rights; or if a sparrow come before my
window, I take part in its existence, and pick about the
gravel.”</p>

<p>For painting Keats had a good deal of taste, largely
fostered, no doubt, by his intimacy with Haydon. This
came to him gradually. Towards the beginning of 1818
he was, according to his own account, quite unable to
appreciate Raphael’s Cartoons, but afterwards gained an
insight into them through contrasting them with some
maudlin saints by Guido. It is interesting to find him
entering warmly into the beauties of the earlier Italian
art, as indicated in a book of prints from some church in
Milan (so he says, but perhaps it should rather be Pisa
or Florence). “I do not think I ever had a greater
treat out of Shakespeare; full of romance and the most
tender feeling; magnificence of drapery beyond everything
I ever saw, not excepting Raphael’s, but grotesque
to a curious pitch&mdash;yet still making up a fine whole, even
finer to me than more accomplished works, as there was
left so much room for imagination.”</p>

<p>Here is a small trait of character, recorded by Keats
in a letter to George, from Winchester, September 1819.
“I feel I can bear real ills better than imaginary ones.
Whenever I find myself growing vapourish, I rouse
myself, wash, and put on a clean shirt, brush my hair and
clothes, tie my shoe-strings neatly, and in fact adonize as if
I were going out; then, all clean and comfortable, I sit
down to write. This I find the greatest relief.”</p>

<p>Haydon, as we have seen, said that Keats had an
exquisite sense of humour. There are few things more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
difficult to analyse than the sense of humour; few points
as to which different people will vary more in opinion
than the possession, by any particular man, of a sense of
humour, or the account, good or bad, to which he turned
this sense. Certainly there is a large amount of jocularity
in the familiar writings of Keats&mdash;often a quick perception
of the ridiculous or the risible, sometimes a telling
jest or <i>jeu d’esprit</i>. I confess, however, that to myself
most of Keats’s fun appears forced or inept, wanting in
fineness of taste and manner, and tending towards the
vulgar; a jangling jingle of word and notion. Punning
plays a large part in it, as it did in Leigh Hunt’s familiar
converse. Some specimens of Keats’s funning or punning
seem to me a humiliating exhibition, as, for instance,
a letter, January 1819, which Armitage Brown addressed
to Mr. and Mrs. Dilke, with interpolations by Keats.
No doubt both the friends were resolutely bent upon
being silly on that occasion; but to be silly is not fully
tantamount to being “a fellow of infinite jest,” or having
an exquisite sense of humour. There is some very exasperating
writing also in a letter to Reynolds (May
1818), about “making Wordsworth and Colman play at
leap-frog, or keeping one of them down a whole half-holiday
at fly-the-garter,” &amp;c., &amp;c. A feeling for the
inappropriate is perhaps one element of jocoseness; if
so, Keats may have been genuinely jocose when (as he
wrote in his very last letter to Brown) he “at his worst,
even in quarantine [in Naples Harbour], summoned up
more puns, in a sort of desperation, in one week than in
any year of his life.” He had a good power of mimicry,
as well as of dramatic recital. He did indisputably,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
towards September 1819, play off one practical joke&mdash;Brown
was the victim&mdash;with eminent success; pretending
that a certain Mr. Nathan Benjamin, who was then
renting Brown’s house at Hampstead, had written a letter
complaining of illness&mdash;gravel, caused by some lime-tainted
water on the premises. But the success depended
upon a very singular coincidence, viz., that by mere
chance Keats had happened to give the tenant’s name
correctly. The angry reply of Brown to the angry supposititious
letter of Benjamin, and the astonishment of
Benjamin upon receiving Brown’s retort, are fertile of
laughter.</p>

<p>Keats does not appear to have ever made any pretence
to defined religious belief of any sort, nor seriously to
have debated the subject, or troubled his mind about it
one way or the other. He was certainly not a Christian.
His early friend, Mr. Felton Mathew, speaks of him as
“of the sceptical and republican school.” On Christmas
Eve, 1816, soon after he had come of age, he wrote the
following sonnet&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“The church-bells toll a melancholy round,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Calling the people to some other prayers,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Some other gloominess, more dreadful cares,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More hearkening to the sermon’s horrid sound.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Surely the mind of man is closely bound<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In some black spell: seeing that each one tears<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Himself from fireside joys and Lydian airs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And converse high of those with glory crowned.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Still, still they toll: and I should feel a damp,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A chill as from a tomb, did I not know<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">That they are dying like an outburnt lamp,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That ’tis their sighing, wailing, ere they go<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Into oblivion,&mdash;that fresh flowers will grow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And many glories of immortal stamp.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>His sonnet on Ben Nevis, 1818, is also an utterance of
scepticism&mdash;speaking of heaven and hell as misty surmises,
and of “the world of thought and mental might”
as a realm of nebulosity. A letter to Leigh Hunt, May
1817, contains a phrase arraigning the God of Christians.
To the clerical student Bailey, September 1818, he
spoke out: “You know my ideas about religion. I do
not think myself more in the right than other people,
that nothing in this world is proveable.” The latter
clause appears to be carelessly elliptical in expression,
the real meaning being “I think [not “I do <i>not</i> think"]
that nothing in this world is proveable.” To Fanny
Brawne, towards May 1820, he appealed “by the blood
of that Christ you believe in.” Haydon tells a noticeable
anecdote&mdash;the only one, I think, which exhibits Keats as
an admirer of that anti-imaginative order of intellect of
which Voltaire was a prototype&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“He had a tending to religion when first I knew him
[autumn of 1816], but Leigh Hunt soon forced it from
his mind. Never shall I forget Keats once rising from
his chair, and approaching my last picture, Entry into
Jerusalem. He went before the portrait of Voltaire,
placed his hand on his heart, and, bowing low,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">‘In reverence done, as to the power<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That dwelt within, whose presence had infused<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into the plant sciential sap derived<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From nectar, drink of gods,’<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>
<p>(as Milton says of Eve after she had eaten the apple),
‘That’s the being to whom <i>I</i> bend,’ said he; alluding to
the bending of the other figures in the picture, and contrasting
Voltaire with our Saviour, and his own adoration
with that of the crowd.”</p></div>

<p>Notwithstanding the general vagueness or indifference
of his mind in religious matters, Keats seems to
have been at most times a believer in the immortality of
the soul. Following that phrase of his already quoted
(from a letter to Bailey, November 1817) “Oh for a life
of sensations rather than of thoughts!” he proceeds: “It
is ‘a vision in the form of youth,’ a shadow of reality to
come. And this consideration has further convinced me&mdash;for
it has come as auxiliary to another favourite speculation
of mine&mdash;that we shall enjoy ourselves hereafter
by having what we call happiness on earth repeated in a
finer tone. And yet such a fate can only befall those
who delight in sensation, rather than hunger, as you do,
after truth. Adam’s dream will do here: and seems to
be a conviction that imagination, and its empyreal reflexion,
is the same as human life, and its spiritual
repetition.” This allusion to “Adam’s dream” refers
back to a fine phrase which had occurred shortly
before in the same letter&mdash;“Imagination may be compared
to Adam’s dream; he awoke, and found it truth.”
In a letter written to George Keats and his wife, shortly
after the death of Tom, comes a very positive assertion&mdash;“I
have a firm belief in immortality, and so had Tom.”
This firm belief, however, must certainly have faltered
later on; for, as we have already seen, one of Keats’s<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
letters to Miss Brawne, written in 1820, contains the
phrase “I long to believe in immortality.” The reader
may also refer to the letter to Armitage Brown, September
1820, extracted in a previous page. Of superstitious
feeling I observe only one instance in Keats. After
Tom’s death, a white rabbit appeared in the garden of
Mr. Dilke, and was shot by him: Keats would have it
that this rabbit was the spirit of Tom, and he persisted
in the fancy with not a little earnestness.</p>

<p>Of Keats’s fondness for wine&mdash;his appreciation of it as
a flavour grateful to the palate, and to the abstract sense
of enjoyment&mdash;there are numerous traces throughout
his writings. We all remember the famous lines in his
“Ode to a Nightingale”&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Oh for a draught of vintage that hath been<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cooled a long age in the deep-delvèd earth,...<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh for a beaker full of the warm South!” &amp;c.&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>lines which seem a little forced into their context, and of
which the only tangible meaning there is that the luxury
and dreamy inspiration of wine-drinking would relieve
the poet’s mind from the dull and painful realities of life,
and assist his imagination into the dim vocal haunts of
the nightingale. There is also in “Lamia” a conspicuous
passage celebrating “The happy vintage&mdash;merry
wine, sweet wine.” On claret&mdash;as to which we have
heard the evidence of Haydon&mdash;there is a long tirade in
a letter addressed to George Keats and his wife in
February 1819. I give it in a condensed form:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot"><p>“I never drink above three glasses of wine, and never
any spirits and water.... How I like claret! When I
can get claret, I must drink it. ’Tis the only palate affair
that I am at all sensual in.... It fills one’s mouth with
a gushing freshness&mdash;then goes down cool and feverless:
then you do not feel it quarrelling with one’s liver....
Other wines of a heavy and spirituous nature transform
a man into a Silenus: this makes him a Hermes, and
gives a woman the soul and immortality of an Ariadne....
I said this same claret is the only palate-passion I
have: I forgot game. I must plead guilty to the breast
of a partridge, the back of a hare, the backbone of a
grouse, the wing and side of a pheasant, and a woodcock
<i>passim</i>.”</p></div>

<p>At a rather later date, October 1819, Keats had “left
off animal food, that my brains may never henceforth be
in a greater mist than is theirs by nature.” But I presume
this form of abstinence did not last long.</p>

<p>I have now gone through the principal points which
appear to me to identify Keats as a man, and to throw
light upon his character and habits. He entered on life
high-spirited, ardent, impulsive, vehement; with plenty
of self-confidence, ballasted with a large capacity (though
he did not always exercise it to a practical result) for
self-criticism; longing to be a poet, and firmly believing
that he could and would be one; resolute to be a man&mdash;unselfish,
kindly, and generous. But, though kindly, he
was irritable; though unselfish and generous, wilful and
suspicious. An affront was what he would not bear; and,
when he found himself affronted in a form&mdash;that of press
ridicule and detraction&mdash;which could not be resented in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
person, nor readily retaliated in any way, it is abundantly
probable that the indignity preyed upon his mind and
spirits, and contributed to embitter the days cut short by
disease, the messenger of despair to that passionate love
which had become the single intense interest of his life.
The single intense interest, along with poetry&mdash;both of
them hurrying without fruition to the grave. Keats seems
to me to have been naturally a man of complex character,
many-mooded, with a tendency to perverse self-conflict.
The circumstances of his brief career&mdash;his poetic ambition,
his want of any definite employment, his association
with men of literary occupation or taste whom he only
half approved, the critical venom poured forth against
him, his love thwarted by a mortal malady&mdash;all these
things tended to bring out the unruly or morbid, and to
deplete the many fine and solid, elements in his nature.
With the personal character of Keats, as with his
writings, we may perhaps deal most fairly by saying that
his outburst and his reserve of faculty were such that, in
the narrow space allotted to him, youth had not advanced
far enough to disentangle the rich and various material.
But his latest years, which enabled his poetry to find full
and deathless voice, were so loaded with suffering and
perturbation as to leave the character less lucidly and
harmoniously developed than even in the days of adolescence. From “Endymion” to “Lamia” and the “Eve
of St. Mark,” we have, in poetry, advanced greatly towards
the radiant meridian: in life, from 1818 to 1821,
we have receded to a baffling dusk.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX.</h2>


<p>We have seen what John Keats did in the shifting
scene of the world, and in the high arena of
poesy; we have seen what were the qualities of character
and of mind which enabled him to bear his part in each.
His work as a poet is to us the thing of primary importance:
and it remains for us to consider what this poetic
work amounts to in essence and in detail. The critic
who <i>is</i> a critic&mdash;and not a <i>Quarterly</i> or a <i>Blackwood</i>
reviewer or lampooner&mdash;is well aware of the disproportion
between his power of estimation, and the demand
which such a genius as that of Keats, and such work as
the maturest which he produced, make upon the estimating
faculty. But this consideration cannot be allowed
to operate beyond a certain point: the estimate has to
be given&mdash;and given candidly and distinctly, however
imperfectly. I shall therefore proceed to express my real
opinion of Keats’s poems, whether an admiring opinion
or otherwise; and shall write without reiterating&mdash;what I
may nevertheless feel&mdash;a sense of the presumption involved
in such a process. I shall in the main, as in
previous chapters, follow the chronological order of the
poems.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>As we have seen, Keats began versifying chiefly under
a Spenserean influence; and it has been suggested that
this influence remained puissant for harm as well as for
good up to the close of his poetic career. I do not see
much force in the suggestion: unless in this limited sense&mdash;that
Spenser, like other Elizabethan and Jacobean
poets his successors, allowed himself very considerable
latitude in saying whatever came into his head, relevant
or irrelevant, appropriate or jarring, obvious or far-fetched,
simple or grandiose, according to the mood of
the moment and the swing of composition, and thus the
whole strain presents an aspect more of rich and arbitrary
picturesqueness than of ordered suavity. And
Keats no doubt often did the same: but not in the
choicest productions of his later time, nor perhaps so
much under incitement from Spenser as in pursuance of
that revolt from a factitious and constrained model of
work in which Wordsworth in one direction, Coleridge
in another, and Leigh Hunt in a third, had already come
forward with practice and precept. Making allowance
for a few early attempts directly referable to Spenser, I
find, even in Keats’s first volume, little in which that
influence is paramount. He seems to have written because
his perceptions were quick, his sympathies vivid in
certain directions, and his energies wound up to poetic
endeavour. The mannerisms of thought, method, and
diction, are much more those of Hunt than of Spenser;
and it is extremely probable that the soreness against
Hunt which Keats evidenced at a later period was due
to his perceiving that that kindly friend and genial
literary ally had misled him into some poetic trivialities<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
and absurdities, not less than to anything in himself
which could be taken hold of for complaint.</p>

<p>Keats’s first volume would present nothing worthy of
permanent memory, were it not for his after achievements,
and for the single sonnet upon Chapman’s
Homer. Several of the compositions are veritable
rubbish: probably Keats knew at the time that they
were not good, and knew soon afterwards that they
were deplorably bad. Such are the address “To Some
Ladies” who had sent the author a shell; that “On
Receiving a Curious Shell and a Copy of Verses [Moore’s
“Golden Chain”] from the same Ladies;” the “Ode to
Apollo” (in which Homer, Virgil, Milton, Shakespeare,
Spenser, and Tasso, are commemorated); the “Hymn
to Apollo;” the lines “To Hope” (in which there is a
patriotic aspiration, mingled with scorn for the gauds of
a Court). “Calidore” has a certain boyish ardour,
clearly indicated if not well expressed. The verses “I
stood tiptoe upon a little hill” are very far from good,
and are stuffed with affectations, but do nevertheless
show a considerable spice of the real Keats. Some lines
have already been quoted from this effusion, about
“flowery nests,” and “the pillowy silkiness that rests full
in the speculation of the stars.” It is only by an effort
that we can attach any meaning to either of these
childish Della-Cruscanisms: the “pillowy silkiness” may
perhaps be clouds intermingled with stars, and the
“flowery nests” may, by a great wrenching of English,
be meant for “flowery nooks”&mdash;nests or nooks of
flowers. “Sleep and Poetry” contains various fine
lines, telling and suggestive images, and luscious descrip<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>tive
snatches, and is interesting as showing the bent of
the writer’s mind, and a sense of his mission begun.
Serious metrical flaws are perceptible in it here and
there, and throughout this first volume of verse&mdash;and
indeed in “Endymion” as well. One metrical weakness
of which he never got rid is the accenting of the preterite
or participial form “ed” (in such words as “resolved,”
&amp;c.), where its sound ekes out with feeble stress the
prosody of a line. Two songs which have genuine lyric
grace&mdash;dated in 1817, but not included in the volume of
“Poems”&mdash;are those which begin “Think not of it,
sweet one, so,” and “Unfelt, unheard, unseen.” The
volume contains sixteen sonnets, besides the grand one
on “Chapman’s Homer.” The best are those which
begin “Keen fitful gusts are whispering here and there,”
and “Happy is England,” and the “Grasshopper and
Cricket,” which was written in competition with Hunt.
It seems to me that Keats’s production has more of
poetry, Hunt’s of finish. The sonnet “On leaving some
friends at an early hour” is characteristic enough. This
is as much detail as need be given here to the “Poems”
of 1817. The sonnet on Chapman’s Homer revealed a
hand which might easily prove to be a master’s. All
else was prentice-work, with some melody, some richness
and freshness, some independence, much enthusiasm;
also many solecisms and perversities of diction, imagery,
and method: and not a few pieces were included which
only self-conceit, or torpor of the critical faculty, or the
mis-persuasion of friends, could have allowed to pass
muster. But Keats chose to publish&mdash;to exhibit his
poetic identity at this stage and in this guise; and of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
course we can see, in the light of his after-work, that the
experiment was rather a rash forestalling than a positive
mistake.</p>

<p>There are a few other sonnets which Keats wrote in
1817, or, in general terms, between the publishing dates
of the “Poems” volume and of “Endymion.” Those
“On a Picture of Leander,” and “On the Sea,” and the
one which begins “After dark vapours have oppressed
our plains,” rank among the best of his juvenile productions.
A general observation, applicable to all the early
work, whether printed at the time or unprinted, is that
the ideas are constantly <i>expressed</i> in an imperfect way.
There are perceptions, thoughts, and emotions; but the
vehicle of words is, as a rule, huddled and approximate.</p>

<p>“Endymion” now claims our attention. I believe
that no better criticism of “Endymion” has ever been
written than that which Shelley supplied in a letter dated
in September 1819. Certainly no criticism which is
equally short is also equally good. I therefore extract it
here, and shall have little to say about the poem which
is not potentially condensed into Shelley’s brief utterance.
“I have read Keats’s poem,” he wrote: “much praise is
due to me for having read it, the author’s intention
appearing to be that no person should possibly get to
the end of it. Yet it is full of some of the highest and the
finest gleams of poetry; indeed, everything seems to be
viewed by the mind of a poet which is described in it.
I think if he had printed about fifty pages of fragments
from it I should have been led to admire Keats as a
poet more than I ought, of which there is now no danger.”
In July 1820 Shelley wrote to Keats himself on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
subject, furnishing almost the only addendum which
could have been needed to the preceding remarks: “I
have lately read your ‘Endymion’ again, and even with
a new sense of the treasures of poetry it contains, though
treasures poured forth with indistinct profusion.” As
Shelley shared with Gifford the conviction that it is
difficult to read “Endymion” from book 1, line 1, to
book 4, line 1003, and as human nature has not changed
essentially since the time of that pre-eminent poet and
that rather less eminent critic, I daresay that there are
at this day several Keats-enthusiasts who know <i>in foro
conscientiæ</i>, though they may not avow in public, that
they have left “Endymion” unread, or only partially
read. Others have perused it, but have found in it so
much “indistinct profusion” that they also remain after
a while with rather a vague impression of the course of
the story; although they agree with Gifford, and even
exceed him in the assurance, that “it seems to be
mythological, and probably relates to the loves of Diana and
Endymion.” As the poem is an extremely important
one in relation to the life-work of Keats, I think it may
not be out of place if I here give a succinct account of
what the narrative really amounts to. This may be all
the more desirable as Keats has not followed the
convenient if prosaic practice of several other epic poets by
prefixing to the several books of his long poem an
“argument” of their respective contents.</p>

<p><i>Book 1.</i> On a lawn within a forest upon a slope of
Mount Latmos was held one morning a festival to Pan.
The young huntsman-chieftain Endymion attended, but
his demeanour betrayed a secret preoccupation and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
trouble. After the rites were over, his sister Peona addressed
him, and gradually won him to open his heart to
her. He told her that at a certain spot by the river, one of
his favourite haunts, he had lately seen a sudden efflorescence
of dittany and poppies (the flowers sacred to
Diana). He fell asleep there, and had a dream or
vision of entering the gates of heaven, seeing the moon
in transcendent splendour, and then being accosted by a
woman or goddess lovely beyond words, who pressed his
hand. He seemed to faint, and to be upborne into the
upper regions of the sky, where he gave the beauty a
rapturous kiss, and then they both paused upon a mountain-side.
Next he dreamed that he fell asleep. This
was the prelude to his actual waking out of the vision.
Ever since he had retained a mysterious sense that the
dream had not been all a dream. This was confirmed
by various incidents of obscure suggestion, and especially
by his hearing in a cavern the words (we have read them
already, beslavered by the “human serpentry” of criticism,
but they remain delicious words none the less)&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Endymion, the cave is secreter<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than the isle of Delos. Echo hence shall stir<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No sighs but sigh-warm kisses, or light noise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of thy combing hand, the while it travelling cloys<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And trembles through my labyrinthine hair.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>As nothing further, however, had happened, Endymion
promised Peona that he would henceforth cease to live
a life of feverish expectation, and would resume the calm
tenor of his days.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Book 2.</i>&mdash;Endymion’s promise had not been strictly
fulfilled; he was still restless and craving. One day he
plucked a rosebud: it suddenly blossomed, and a butterfly
emerged from it, with strangely-charactered wings.
He pursued the butterfly, which led him to a fountain by
a cavern, and then disappeared. A naiad thereupon
addressed him, saying that he must wander far before he
could be reunited to his mystic fair one. He then
appealed to the moon-goddess for some aid, was rapt
into a dizzy vision as if he were sailing through heaven
in her car, and heard a voice from the cavern bidding
him descend into the entrails of the earth. He eagerly
obeyed, and passed through a region of twilight dimness
starred with gems, until he reached a natural temple
enshrining a statue of Diana. An awful sense of solitude
weighed upon him, and he implored the goddess to
restore him to his earthly home. A profusion of flowers
budded forth before his feet, followed by music as he
resumed his journey. At last he came to a verdant
space, peopled with slumbering Cupids. Here in a
beautiful chamber he found Adonis lying tranced on a
couch, attended by other Cupids.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> One of them gave
him wine and fruit, and explained to him the winter-sleep
and summer-life of Adonis; and at this moment<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
Adonis woke up from his trance, and Venus came to
solace him with love. Venus spoke soothingly also to
Endymion, telling him that she knew of his love for some
one of the immortals, but who this was she had failed to
fathom. She promised that one day he should be
blessed, and with Adonis she then rose heavenward in
her car. The earth closed, and Endymion gladly pursued
his way through caves, jewels, and water-springs.
Cybele passed on her lion-drawn chariot. The diamond
path ended in middle air; Endymion invoked Jupiter,
an eagle swooped and bore him down through darkness
into a mossy jasmine-bower. With a sense of ecstasy,
chequered by an unsatisfied longing for his unknown
love, Endymion prepared himself to sleep:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">“And, just into the air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stretching his indolent arms, he took, O bliss!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A naked waist. ‘Fair Cupid, whence is this?’<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A well-known voice sighed, ‘Sweetest, here am I!’”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The lovers indulged their passion in kisses and caresses;
he urgent to know who she might be, and she confessing
herself a goddess hitherto awful in loveless
chastity, but not naming herself, though perhaps her
avowals were sufficiently indicative,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> and she promised to
exalt him ere long to Olympus. The rapturous inter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>view
ended with the sleep of Endymion, and awaking he
found himself alone. He strayed out, and reached an
enormous grotto. Two springs of water gushed forth&mdash;the
springs of Arethusa and Alpheus, whose loves found
voice in words. Endymion, sending up a prayer for
their union, stepped forward and found himself beneath
the sea.</p>

<p><i>Book 3.</i> Soothed by a moonbeam which greeted him
through the waters, Endymion pursued his course. Upon
a rock within the sea he encountered an old, old man,
with wand and book. The ancient man started up as
from a trance, declaring that he should now be young
again and happy. This was Glaucus, who imparted to
Endymion the story of his ill-omened love for Scylla (it is
told at considerable length, but need not be detailed
here), the witchcraft of Circe which had doomed him to
a ghastly marine life of a thousand years, and how, after
a shipwreck, he came into possession of a book of magic,
which revealed to him that at some far-off day a youth
should make his appearance and break the accursed
spell. In Endymion, Glaucus recognized the predicted
youth. Glaucus then led Endymion to an edifice in
which he had preserved the corpse of Scylla, and thousands
of other corpses, being those of lovers who had
been shipwrecked during his many cycles of sea-dwelling
doom. Glaucus tore his scroll into fragments, bound
his cloak round Endymion, and waved his wand nine
times. He then instructed Endymion to unwind a
tangled thread, read the markings on a shell, break the
wand against a lyre, and strew the fragments of the scroll
upon Glaucus himself, and upon the dead bodies. As<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
the final act was performed, Glaucus resumed his youth,
and Scylla and the drowned lovers returned to life. The
whole joyous company then rushed off, and paid their
devotions to Neptune in his palace. Cupid and Venus
were also present here; and the goddess of love spoke
words of comfort to Endymion, assuring him that his long
expectancy would soon find its full reward. She had by
this time probed the secret of Diana, but she refrained
from naming that deity to Endymion. She invited him
and his bride to pass a portion of their honeymoon in
Cythera,<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> with Adonis and Cupid. A stupendous festival
in Neptune’s palace succeeded. Endymion finally sank
down in a trance; Nereids conveyed him up to a forest
by a lake; and as he floated earthwards he heard in
dream words promising that his goddess would soon waft
him up into heaven. He awoke in the sylvan scene.</p>

<p><i>Book 4.</i> The first sound that Endymion heard was a
female voice; the wail of a damsel who had followed
Bacchus from the banks of the Ganges, and who longed
to be at home again, if only to die there. Unseen himself,
he saw a beautiful girl, who lay bemoaning her
loveless lot. He at once felt that, if he adored his
unknown goddess, he loved also his Indian Bacchante.
He sprang forward and declared his passion.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> She, after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
chaunting her long journeyings in the train of Bacchus,
explained that, being sick-hearted and weary, she had
strayed away in the forest, and was now but the votary
of sorrow. Endymion continued to woo her with sweet
words and hot: he heard a dismal voice, “Woe to
Endymion!” echoing through the forest. Mercury
descended and touched the ground with his wand, and
two winged horses sprang out of the earth. Endymion
seated his Bacchante upon one horse and mounted the
other; they flew upward, eagle-high. In the air they
passed Sleep, who had heard a report that a mortal was
to wed a daughter of Jove, and who desired to hearken
to the marriage ditties before he returned to his cave.
The influence of Sleep made the winged horses drowse,
and also Endymion and the Bacchante. Endymion then
dreamed of being in heaven, the mate of gods and
goddesses, Diana among them. In dream he sprang
towards Diana, and so awoke; but awake he still saw
the same vision. Diana was there in heaven; his Bacchante
was beside him lying on the horse’s pinions. He
kissed the Bacchante, and almost in the same breath
protested to Diana his unshaken constancy. The Bacchante
then awoke. Endymion, dazed in mind with his
divided allegiance, urged her to be gone, and the
winged horses resumed their flight. They advanced
towards the galaxy, the moon peeped out of the sky, the
Bacchante faded away in the moonbeams. Her steed
dropped down to the earth; while the one which bore
Endymion continued mounting upwards, and he again
fell into a sort of trance. He heard not the celestial
messengers bespeaking guests to Diana’s wedding. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
winged horse then carried Endymion down to a hill-top.
Here once more he found his beautiful Indian, and for
her sake forswore all præterhuman passion. She, however,
declared to him that a divine terror forbade her
to be his. His sister Peona now re-appeared. She
rallied him and the Bacchante on their love and melancholy,
both equally obvious, and bade him attend at
night a festival to Diana, whom the soothsayers had pronounced
to be in a mood peculiarly propitious. Endymion
announced his resolution to abandon the world,
and live an eremitic life: Peona and the fair Indian
should both be his sisters. The Indian vowed lifelong
chastity, devoted to Diana. Both the women then
retired. The day passed over Endymion motionless and
mute. At eventide he walked towards the temple: he
heeded not the hymning to Diana. Peona, companioned
by the Indian damsel, accosted him. He replied,
“Sister, I would have command, if it were heaven’s
will, on our sad fate.” The Indian replied that this he
should assuredly have; as she spoke she changed semblance,
and stood revealed as Diana herself. She laid
upon her own fears and upon fate the blame of past
delays, and told Endymion that it had also been fitting
that he should be spiritualized out of mortality by some
unlooked-for change. As Endymion kneeled and kissed
her hands, they both vanished away. The last words of
the poem are&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i14">“Peona went<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Home through the gloomy wood in wonderment:”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>words which may perhaps be modelled upon the grave
and subdued conclusion of “Paradise Lost.”<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>This is a bald outline of the thread of story which
meanders through that often-skimmed, seldom-read, not
easily readable poem&mdash;in snatches alluring, in entirety
disheartening&mdash;the “Endymion” of Keats. It will be
perceived that the poet keeps throughout tolerably close
to his main and professed subject matter&mdash;the loves of
Diana and Endymion, although the episode of Glaucus,
which is brought within the compass of the amorous
quest, is certainly a very long and extraneous one. As
we have seen, Keats, when well advanced with this poem,
spoke of it as a test of his inventive faculty: and truly it
is such, but I am not sure that his inventive faculty has
come extremely well out of the ordeal. The best part
which invention could take in such an attempt would be
a vigorous, sane, and adequate conception of the imaginable
relation between a loving goddess and her human
lover; her emotion towards him, and his emotion towards
her; and his ultimate semi-spiritualized and semi-human
mode of existence in the divine conclave; along with a
chain of incidents&mdash;partly of mythologic tradition, partly
the poet’s own&mdash;which should illustrate these essential
elements of the legend, and take possession of the reader’s
mind, for their own sake at the moment, and for the sake
of the main conception as ultimate result. Of all this we
find little in Keats’s poem. Diana figures as a very willing
woman, passing out of the stage of maidenly coyness.
Endymion talks indeed at times of the exaltation of a
passion transcending the bounds of mortality, but his
conduct and demeanour go little beyond those of an
adventurous lover of the knight-errant sort who, having
taken the first leap in the dark, follows where Fortune<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
leads him&mdash;and assuredly she leads him a very curious
dance, where one cannot make out how his human
organism, with respirative and digestive processes, continues
to exist. Moreover, the last book of the poem
spoils all that has preceded, so far as continuity of feeling
is concerned; for here we learn that no sooner does
Endymion see a pretty Indian Bacchante than he falls
madly in love with her, and casts to the winds every
shred and thought of Diana, already his bride or quasi-bride;
she goes out like a cloud-veiled glimpse of moonlight.
True, the Bacchante is in fact Diana herself; but
of this Endymion knows nothing at all, and he deliberately&mdash;or
rather with fatuous precipitancy&mdash;gives up the
glorious goddess for the sentimental and beguiling wine-bibber.
Diana, when she re-assumes her proper person,
has not a word of reproach to level at him. This may
possibly be true to the nature of a goddess&mdash;it is certainly
not so to that of a woman; and it is the only crisis at
which she shows herself different from womanhood&mdash;shall
we say superior to it?</p>

<p>In another and minor sense there is no lack of invention
in this Poetic Romance. So far as I know, there is
nothing in Grecian mythology furnishing a nucleus for
the incidents of Endymion’s descending into the bowels
of the earth, passing thence beneath the sea, meeting
Glaucus, and restoring to life the myriads of drowned
lovers, encountering the Indian Bacchante, and taking
with her an aërial voyage upon winged coursers. These
incidents&mdash;except indeed that of the Bacchante&mdash;are
passing strange, and could not be worked out in a long
narrative poem without a lavish command of fanciful and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
surprising touches. The tale of the aërial voyage seems
abortive; its natural <i>raison d’être</i> and needful sequel
would appear to be that Diana, having thus launched
Endymion along with herself into the heavenly regions,
should bear him straight onward to the high court of the
gods; but, instead of that, the horses and their riders
return to earth, the air has been traversed to no purpose
and with no ostensible result, and Endymion is allowed
again to forswear Diana for the Bacchante before the
consummation is reached. Presumably Morpheus (Sleep)
is responsible for this mishap. His untoward presence
in the sky sent the Bacchante, as well as Endymion, to
sleep for awhile: when they awoke, Diana had to leave
the form of the Bacchante, and, in her character of
Phœbe, regulate the nascent moon; though a goddess,
she could not be in two places at once, and so the winged
horses descended <i>re infectâ</i>. This is an ingenious point
of incident enough; but it is just one of those points
which indicate that the poet’s mind moved in a region of
scintillating details rather than of large and majestic
contours.</p>

<p>Such is in fact the quality of “Endymion” throughout.
Everything is done for the sake of variegation and
embroidery of the original fabric; or we might compare it
to a richly-shot silk which, at every rustling movement,
catches the eye with a change of colour. Constant as
they are, the changes soon become fatiguing, and in
effect monotonous; one colour, varied with its natural
light and shade, would be more restful to the sight, and
would even, in the long run, leave a sense of greater,
because more congruous and harmonized, variety. Lus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>cious
and luxuriant in intention&mdash;for I cannot suppose
that Keats aimed at being exalted or ideal&mdash;the poem
becomes mawkish in result: he said so himself, and we
need not hesitate to repeat it. Affectations, conceits,
and puerilities, abound, both in thought and in diction:
however willing to be pleased, the reader is often disconcerted
and provoked. The number of clever things said
cleverly, of rich things richly, and of fine things finely, is
however abundant and superabundant; and no one who
peruses “Endymion” with a true sense for poetic endowment
and handling can fail to see that it is peculiarly the
work of a poet. The versification, though far from faultless,
is free, surging, and melodious&mdash;one of the devices
which the author most constantly employs with a view to
avoiding jogtrot uniformity being that of beginning a new
sentence with the second line of a couplet. On every
page the poet has enjoyed himself, and on most of them
the reader can joy as well. The lyrical interludes, especially
the hymn to Pan, and the chaunt of the Bacchante
(which comprises a sort of verse-transcript of Titian’s
“Bacchus and Ariadne”), are singularly wealthy in that
fancy which hovers between description and emotion.
The hymn to Pan was pronounced by Wordsworth, <i>vivâ
voce</i>, to be “a pretty piece of paganism”&mdash;a comment
which annoyed Keats not a little. Shelley (in his undispatched
letter to the editor of the <i>Quarterly Review</i>)
pointed out, as particularly worthy of attention, the passages&mdash;“And
then the forest told it in a dream” (book
ii.); “The rosy veils mantling the East” (book iii.); and
“Upon a weeded rock this old man sat” (book iii.) The
last&mdash;relating to Glaucus and his pictured cloak&mdash;is cer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>tainly
remarkable; the other two, I should say, not more
remarkable than scores of others&mdash;as indeed Shelley himself
implied.</p>

<p>To sum up, “Endymion” is an essentially poetical
poem, which sins, and greatly or even grossly does it sin,
by youthful indiscipline and by excess. To deny these
blemishes would be childish&mdash;they are there, and must be
not only admitted, but resented. The faults, like the
beauties, of the poem, are positive&mdash;not negative or neutral.
The work was in fact (as Keats has already told us) a
venture of an experimental kind. At the age of twenty-one
to twenty-two he had a mind full of poetic material;
he turned out his mind into this poetic romance, conscious
that, if some things came right, others would come
wrong. We are the richer for his rather overweening
experiment; we are not to ignore its conditions, nor its
partial failure, but we have to thank him none the less.
If “a thing of beauty is a joy for ever,” a thing of alloyed
beauty is a joy in its minor degree.</p>

<p>The next long poem of Keats&mdash;“Isabella, or the Pot
of Basil”&mdash;is a vast advance on “Endymion” in sureness
of hand and moderation of work: it is in all respects the
better poem, and justifies what Keats said (in his letter of
October 9, 1818, quoted in our Chapter v.) of the experience
which he was sure to gain by the adventurous plunge
he had made in “Endymion.” Of course it was a less
arduous attempt; the subject being one of directly human
passion, the story ready-furnished to him by Boccaccio,
and the narrative much briefer. Except in altering the
locality from Messina to Florence (a change which seems
objectless), Keats has adhered faithfully enough to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
sweet and sad story of Boccaccio; he has however amplified
it much in detail, for the Italian tale is a short one.
“Isabella” has always been a favourite with the readers
of Keats, and deservedly so; it is tender, touching, and
picturesque. Yet I should not place it in the very first
rank of the poet’s works&mdash;the treatment seems to me at
once more ambitious and less masculine than is needed.
The writer seems too conscious that he has set himself
to narrating something pathetic; he tells the story
<i>ab extra</i>, and enlarges on “the pity of it,” instead of
leaving the pity to speak to the heart out of the very circumstances
themselves. The brothers may have been
“ledger-men” and “money-bags” (Boccaccio does not
insist upon any such phase of character), and they certainly
became criminals, though the Italian author treats
their murder of Lorenzo as if it were a sufficiently obvious
act in vindication of the family honour; but, when Keats
“again asks aloud” why these commercial brothers were
proud, he seems to intrude upon us overmuch the personality
of the narrator of a tragic story, and pounds away at
his text like a pulpiteer. This is only one instance of
the flaw which runs through the poem&mdash;that it is all told
as with a direct appeal to the reader to be sympathetic&mdash;indignant
now, and now compassionate. Leigh Hunt has
pointed out the absurdity of putting into the mouth of
one of the brother “money-bags,” just as they are about
to execute their plot for murdering Lorenzo, the lines
(though he praises the pretty conceit in itself)&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Come down, we pray thee, ere the hot sun count<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His dewy rosary on the eglantine.”<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></div></div>

<p>The author’s invocation to Melancholy, Music, Echo,
Spirits in grief, and Melpomene, to condole the approaching
death of Isabella, seems to me a <i>fadeur</i> hardly
more appropriate than the money-bag’s epigram upon the
“dewy rosary.” But the reader is probably tired of my
qualifying clauses for the admiration with which he regards
“The Pot of Basil.” He thinks it both beautiful
and pathetic&mdash;and so do I.</p>

<p>“Isabella” is written in the octave stanza; “The
Eve of St. Agnes” in the Spenserean. This difference
of metre corresponds very closely to the difference of
character between the two poems. “Isabella” is a narrative
poem of event and passion, in which the incidents
are presented so as chiefly to subserve purposes of sentiment;
“The Eve of St. Agnes,” though it assumes a
narrative form, is hardly a narrative, but rather a monody
of dreamy richness, a pictured and scenic presentment,
which sentiment again permeates and over-rules. I
rate it far above “Isabella”&mdash;and indeed above all those
poems of Keats, not purely lyrical, in which human or
quasi-human agents bear their part, except only the
ballad “La Belle Dame sans Merci,” and the uncompleted
“Eve of St. Mark.” “Hyperion” stands aloof in
lonely majesty; but I think that, in the long run, even
“Hyperion” represents the genius of Keats less adequately,
and past question less characteristically, than “The Eve
of St. Agnes.” The story of this fascinating poem is so
meagre as to be almost nugatory. There is nothing in it
but this&mdash;that Keats took hold of the superstition proper
to St. Agnes’ Eve, the power of a maiden to see her
absent lover under certain conditions, and added to it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
that a lover, who was clandestinely present in this conjuncture
of circumstances, eloped with his mistress.
This extreme tenuity of constructive power in the poem,
coupled with the rambling excursiveness of “Endymion,”
and the futility of “The Cap and Bells,” might be held
to indicate that Keats had very little head for framing
a story&mdash;and indeed I infer that, if he possessed any
faculty in that direction, it remained undeveloped up
to the day of his death. One of the few subsidiary
incidents introduced into “The Eve of St. Agnes” is
that the lover Porphyro, on emerging from his hiding-place
while his lady is asleep, produces from a cupboard
and marshals to sight a large assortment of appetizing
eatables. Why he did this no critic and no admirer has
yet been able to divine; and the incident is so trivial in
itself, and is made so much of for the purpose of verbal
or metrical embellishment, as to reinforce our persuasion
that Keats’s capacity for framing a story out of successive
details of a suggestive and self-consistent kind
was decidedly feeble. The power of “The Eve of St.
Agnes” lies in a wholly different direction. It lies in the
delicate transfusion of sight and emotion into sound; in
making pictures out of words, or turning words into
pictures; of giving a visionary beauty to the closest
items of description; of holding all the materials of the
poem in a long-drawn suspense of music and reverie.
“The Eve of St. Agnes” is <i>par excellence</i> the poem
of “glamour.” It means next to nothing; but means
that little so exquisitely, and in so rapt a mood of musing
or of trance, that it tells as an intellectual no less than a
sensuous restorative. Perhaps no reader has ever risen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
from “The Eve of St. Agnes” dissatisfied. After a while
he can question the grounds of his satisfaction, and may
possibly find them wanting; but he has only to peruse
the poem again, and the same spell is upon him.</p>

<p>“The Eve of St. Mark” was begun at much the same
date as “The Eve of St. Agnes,” rather the earlier of the
two. Its relation to other poems by the author is
singular. In “Endymion” he had been a prodigal
of treasures&mdash;some of them genuine, others spurious; in
“The Eve of St. Agnes” he was at least opulent, a
magnate superior to sumptuary laws; but in “The Eve
of St. Mark” he subsides into a delightful simplicity&mdash;a
simplicity full, certainly, of “favour and prettiness,”
but chary of ornament. It comes perfectly natural to
him, and promises the most charming results. The non-completion
of “The Eve of St. Mark” is the greatest
grievance of which the admirers of Keats have to complain.
I should suppose that, in the first instance, he
advisedly postponed the eve of one saint, Mark, to the
eve of the other, Agnes; and that he did not afterwards
find a convenient opportunity for resuming the uncompleted
poem. The superstition connected with St. Mark’s
vigil is not wholly unlike that pertaining to St. Agnes’s.
In the former instance (I quote from Dante Rossetti),
“it is believed that, if a person placed himself near the
church porch when twilight was thickening, he would
behold the apparition of those persons in the parish who
were to be seized with any severe disease that year go
into the church. If they remained there, it signified
their death; if they came out again, it portended their
recovery; and, the longer or shorter the time they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
remained in the building, the severer or less dangerous
their illness.” The same writer, forecasting the probable
course of the story,<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> surmised that “the heroine,
remorseful after trifling with a sick and now absent lover,
might make her way to the minster porch to learn his
fate by the spell, and perhaps see his figure enter but not
return.” If this was really to have been the sequel, we
can perceive that the unassuming simplicity of the poem
at its commencement would, ere its close, have deepened
into a different sort of simplicity&mdash;emotional, and even
tragic. As it stands, the simplicity of “The Eve of St.
Mark” is full-blooded as well as quaint&mdash;there is nothing
starved or threadbare about it. Diverse though it is from
Coleridge’s “Christabel,” we seem to feel in it something
of the like possessing or haunting quality, modified by
Keats’s own distinctive genius. In this respect, and in
perfectness of touch, we link it with “La Belle Dame
sans Merci.”</p>

<p>“Hyperion” has next to be considered. This was the
only poem by Keats which Shelley admired in an extreme
degree. He wrote at different dates: “The
fragment called ‘Hyperion’ promises for him that he
is destined to become one of the first writers of the age....
It is certainly an astonishing piece of writing, and
gives me a conception of Keats which I confess I had
not before.... If the ‘Hyperion’ be not grand poetry,
none has been produced by our contemporaries.... The
great proportion of this piece is surely in the very
highest style of poetry.” Byron, who had been particularly
virulent against Keats during his lifetime, wrote<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
after his death a much more memorable phrase: “His
fragment of ‘Hyperion’ seems actually inspired by the
Titans, and is as sublime as Æschylus.” Mr. Swinburne
has written of the poem more at length, and with carefully
weighed words:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“The triumph of ‘Hyperion’ is as nearly complete as
the failure of ‘Endymion.’ Yet Keats never gave such
proof of a manly devotion and rational sense of duty to
his art as in his resolution to leave this great poem unfinished;
not (as we may gather from his correspondence
on the subject) for the pitiful reason assigned by his
publishers, that of discouragement at the reception given
to his former work, but on the solid and reasonable
ground that a Miltonic study had something in its very
scheme and nature too artificial, too studious of a foreign
influence, to be carried on and carried out at such length
as was implied by his original design. Fortified and
purified as it had been on a first revision, when much
introductory allegory and much tentative effusion of
sonorous and superfluous verse had been rigorously
clipped down or pruned away, it could not long have
retained spirit enough to support or inform the shadowy
body of a subject so little charged with tangible significance.”</p></div>

<p>Mr. Swinburne is a critic with whom one may well be
content to go astray, if astray it is. I will therefore
say that I entirely agree with him in this estimate of
“Hyperion,” and of the sound discretion which Keats
exercised in giving it up. To deal with the gods of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
Olympus is no easy task&mdash;it had decidedly overtaxed
Keats in “Endymion,” though he limited himself to the
two goddesses Diana and Venus, and casually the gods
Neptune and Mercury; but to deal with the elder gods&mdash;Saturn,
Ops, Hyperion&mdash;and with the Titans, on the
scale of a long epic narration, is a task which may well
be pronounced unachievable. The Olympian gods would
also have had to be introduced: Apollo already appears
in the poem, not too promisingly. The elder gods are
necessarily mere figure-heads of bulk, might, majesty, and
antiquity; to get any character out of them after these
“property” attributes have been exhausted to the mind’s
eye, to “set them going” in act, and doing something
apportionable into cantos, and readable by human
energies, was not a problem which could be solved
by a poet of the nineteenth century. Past question,
Keats started grandly, and has left us a monument
of Cyclopean architecture in verse almost impeccable&mdash;a
Stonehenge of reverberance; he has made us feel that his
elder gods were profoundly primæval, powers so august
and abstract-natured as to have become already obsolete
in the days of Zeus and Hades: his Titans, too, were so
vast and muscular that no feat would have been difficult
to them except that of interesting us. This sufficed for
the first book of the poem; in the second book, the
enterprise is already revealing itself as an impossible one,
for the council at which Oceanus and others speak is
reminiscent of the Pandæmonic council in Milton, and
clearly very inferior to that. It could not well help
resembling the scene in “Paradise Lost,” nor yet help
being inferior; besides, even were it equal or preferable,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
Milton had done the thing first. The “large utterance
of the early gods,” large though it be, tends to monotony.
In book iii., we go off to Mnemosyne and Apollo; but
of this section little remains, and we close the poem with
a conviction that Keats, if he had succeeded in writing
“a <i>fragment</i> as sublime as Æschylus,” was both prudent
and fortunate in leaving it a fragment. To say that
“Hyperion” is after all a semi-artificial utterance of the
grand would be harsh, and ungrateful for so noble an
effort of noble faculty; but to say that, by being
prolonged, its grandeur must infallibly have partaken more
and more of an artificial infusion, appears to me criticism
entirely sound and safe.</p>

<p>Mr. Woodhouse has informed us: “The poem, if
completed, would have treated of the dethronement of
Hyperion, the former god of the sun, by Apollo; and
incidentally of those of Oceanus by Neptune, of Saturn by
Jupiter, &amp;c., and of the war of the Giants for Saturn’s re-establishment;
with other events of which we have but
very dark hints in the mythological poets of Greece and
Rome. In fact, the incidents would have been pure
creations of the poet’s brain.” Here again Keats would
have been partly forestalled by Milton: the combat of
the Giants with the Olympian gods must have borne a
very appreciable resemblance to the combat of Satan
and his legions with the hosts of heaven. How far
Keats’s “invention” would have sufficed to filling in this
vast canvas may be questioned. The precedent of
“Endymion,” in which he had attempted something of
the same kind, was not wholly encouraging. The method
and tone would of course have been very different; in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
what remains of “Hyperion,” the general current of
diction is as severe as in “Endymion” it had been florid.</p>

<p>The other commencement of “Hyperion” (alluded to
in my sixth chapter) was a later version, done in November
and December 1819; it presents a great deal of poetic
or scenic machinery in which the author’s personality was
copiously introduced. This recast contains impressive
things; but the prominence given to the author as
spectator or participant of what he pictures forth was
fulsome and fatal. Mr. Swinburne is in error (along
with most other writers) in supposing this to be the
earlier version of the two.</p>

<p>The tragedy of “Otho the Great,” written on a peculiar
system of collaboration to which I have already referred,
succeeded “Hyperion.” It is a tragedy on the Elizabethan
model, and we find in scene i. a curious instance
of Elizabethan contempt of chronology&mdash;a reference to
“Hungarian petards.” The main factors in the plot are
a fierce and fervent love-passion of the man, and an unscrupulous
ambition of the woman, reddened with crime.
Webster may perhaps have been taken by Keats as his
chief prototype. To call “Otho the Great” an excellent
drama would not be possible; but it can be read without
tedium, and contains vigorous passages, and lines and
images moulded with a fine poetic ardour. The action
would be sufficient for stage-representation at a time when
an audience come prepared to like a play if it is good in
verse and strong in romantic emotion; under such conditions,
while it could not be a great success, it need not
nevertheless fall manifestly flat. Under any other conditions,
such as those which prevail nowadays, this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
tragedy would necessarily run no chance at all. In a
copy of Keats which belonged to Dante Gabriel Rossetti
I find the following note of his, which may bear extracting:
“This repulsive yet powerful play is of course
in draft only. It is much less to be supposed that it
would have been left so imperfect than to be surmised,
from its imperfection, how very gradual the maturing of
Keats’s best work probably may have been. It gives after
all, perhaps, the strongest proof of <i>robustness</i> that Keats
has left; and as a tragedy is scarcely more deficient than
‘Endymion’ as a poem. Both, viewed as wholes, are
quite below Keats’s three masterpieces;<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> yet ‘Otho,’ as
well as ‘Endymion,’ gives proof of his finest powers.”
Another note from the same hand remarks: “The
character and conduct of Albert [the lover of Auranthe
murdered to clear the way for her ambition] are the
finest point in the play.”</p>

<p>Of the later drama, “King Stephen,” so little was
written that I need not dwell upon it here.</p>

<p>“Lamia” was begun about the same time as “Otho the
Great,” but finished afterwards. The influence of Dryden,
under which it was composed, has told strongly upon its
versification, as marked especially in the very free use of
alexandrines&mdash;generally the third line of a triplet, sometimes
even the second line of a couplet. You might
search “Endymion” in vain for alexandrines; and I will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
admit that their frequency appears to me to give an artificial
tone to “Lamia.” The view which Keats has
elected to take of his subject is worth considering. The
heroine is a serpent-woman, or a double-natured being who
can change from serpent into woman and <i>vice versâ</i>. In
the female form she beguiles a young student of philosophy,
Lycius, lives with him in a splendid palace, and
finally celebrates their marriage-feast. The philosopher
Apollonius attends among the guests, perceives her to be
“human serpentry,” and, gazing on her with ruthless
fixity, he compels her and all her apparatus of enchantment
to vanish. This is the act for which (in lines partly
quoted in these pages) Keats arraigns philosophy, and
its power of stripping things bare of their illusions. No
doubt a poet has a right to treat a legend of this sort
from such point of view as he likes; it is for him, and
not for his reader, to take the bull by the horns. But it
does look rather like taking the bull by the weaker horn
to contend that the philosopher who saves a youthful
disciple from the wiles of a serpent is condemnably
prosaic&mdash;a grovelling spirit that denudes life of its poetry.
Conveniently for Keats’s theory, Lycius is made to die
forthwith after the vanishing of his Lamia. If we invent
a different finale to the poem, and say that Lycius fell
down on his knees, and thanked Apollonius for saving
him from such pestilent delusions and perilous blandishments,
and ever afterwards looked out for the cloven
tongue (if not the cloven hoof) when a pretty woman
made advances to him, we may perhaps come quite as
near to a right construction of so strange a series of
events, and to the true moral of the story. But Keats’s<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
championship was for the enjoying aspects of life; he
may be held to have exercised it here rather perversely.
“Lamia” is one of his completest and most finished
pieces of writing&mdash;perhaps in this respect superior to all
his other long poems, if we except “Hyperion”; it
closes the roll of them with an affluence, even an excess,
of sumptuous adornment. “Lamia” leaves on the mental
palate a rich flavour, if not an absolutely healthy one.</p>

<p>Passing from the long compositions, we find the cream
of Keats’s poetry in the ballad of “La Belle Dame sans
Merci,” and in the five odes&mdash;“To Psyche,” “To
Autumn,” “On Melancholy,” “To a Nightingale,” and
“On a Grecian Urn.” “La Belle Dame sans Merci”
may possibly have been written later than any of the odes,
but this point is uncertain. I give it here as marking the
highest point of romantic imagination to which Keats
attained in dealing with human or quasi-human personages,
and also his highest level of simplicity along with
completeness of art.</p>

<p>This is a poem of <i>impression</i>. The impression is immediate,
final, and permanent; and words would be
more than wasted upon pointing out to the reader that
such and such are the details which have conduced to
impress him.</p>

<p>In the five odes there is naturally some diversity in the
degrees of excellence. I have given their titles above in
the probable (not certain) order of their composition.
Considered intellectually, we might form a kind of
symphony out of them, and arrange it thus&mdash;1, “Grecian
Urn”; 2, “Psyche”; 3, “Autumn”; 4, “Melancholy”;
5, “Nightingale”; and, if Keats had left us nothing
else, we should have in this symphony an almost complete
picture of his poetic mind, only omitting, or
representing deficiently, that more instinctive sort of
enjoyment which partakes of gaiety. Viewing all these
wondrous odes together, the predominant quality which
we trace in them is an extreme susceptibility to delight,
close-linked with afterthought&mdash;pleasure with pang&mdash;or
that poignant sense of ultimates, a sense delicious and
harrowing, which clasps the joy in sadness, and feasts
upon the very sadness in joy. The emotion throughout
is the emotion of beauty: beauty intensely perceived,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
intensely loved, questioned of its secret like the sphinx,
imperishable and eternal, yet haunted (as it were) by its
own ghost, the mortal throes of the human soul. As no
poet had more capacity for enjoyment than Keats, so
none exceeded him in the luxury of sorrow. Few also
exceeded him in the sense of the one moment irretrievable;
but this conception in its fulness belongs to
the region of morals yet more than of sensation, and
the spirit of Keats was almost an alien in the region of
morals. As he himself wrote (March 1818)&mdash;</p>

<span class="i0">“Was it a vision or a waking dream?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fled is that music&mdash;do I wake or sleep?”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>To one or two of these phrases a few words of comment
may be given. That axiom which concludes the
“Ode on a Grecian Urn”&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Beauty is truth, truth beauty,&mdash;that is all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know,”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>is perhaps the most important contribution to thought
which the poetry of Keats contains: it pairs with and
transcends</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“A thing of beauty is a joy for ever.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I am not prepared to say whether Keats was the first
writer to formulate any axiom to this effect,&mdash;I should
rather presume not; but at any rate it comes with peculiar
appropriateness in the writings of a poet who might have
varied the dictum of Iago, and said of himself</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“For I am nothing if not beautiful.”<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></div></div>

<p>In the Ode, the axiom is put forward as the message of
the sculptured Grecian Urn “to man,” and is thus propounded
as being of universal application. It amounts
to saying&mdash;“Any beauty which is not truthful (if any
such there be), and any truth which is not beautiful (if
any such there be), are of no practical importance to
mankind in their mundane condition: but in fact there
are none such, for, to the human mind, beauty and truth
are one and the same thing.” To debate this question
on abstract grounds is not in my province: all that I
have to do is to point out that Keats’s perception and
thought crystallized into this axiom as the sum and substance
of wisdom for man, and that he has bequeathed
it to us to ponder in itself, and to lay to heart as the
secret of his writings. Those other lines, from the “Ode
on Melancholy,” where he says of Melancholy&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“She dwells with Beauty&mdash;Beauty that must die;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And Joy, whose hand is ever at his lips<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bidding adieu”&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>appear to me unsurpassable in the whole range of his
poetry&mdash;as intense in imagery as supreme in diction and
in music. They pair with the other celebrated verses
from the “Ode to a Nightingale”&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Now more then ever seems it rich to die,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To cease upon the midnight with no pain;”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Charmed magic casements opening on the foam<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of perilous seas in faery lands forlorn.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The phrase “<i>rich</i> to die” is of the very essence of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
Keats’s emotion; and the passage about “magic casements”
shows a reach of expression which might almost
be called the Pillars of Hercules of human language.
Far greater things have been said by the greatest minds:
but nothing more perfect in form has been said&mdash;nothing
wider in scale and closer in utterance&mdash;by any mind of
whatsoever pitch of greatness.</p>

<p>And here we come to one of the most intrinsic
properties of Keats’s poetry. He is a master of <i>imagination
in verbal form</i>: he gifts us with things so finely and
magically said as to convey an imaginative impression.
The imagination may sometimes be in the substance of
the thought, as well as in its wording&mdash;as it is in the
passage just quoted: sometimes it resides essentially in
the wording, out of which thought expands in the reader,
who is made</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“To feel for ever its soft fall and swell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Awake for ever in a sweet unrest.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>From wealth of perception, at first confused or docked
in the expression, he rose into a height of verbal embodiment
which has seldom been equalled and seldomer
exceeded. His conception of poetry as an ideal, his
sense of poetry as an art, spurred him on to artistic
achievement; and in the later stages of his work the
character of the Artist is that which marks him most
strongly. As one of his own letters says, he “looks
upon fine phrases like a lover.”</p>

<p>According to Mr. Swinburne, “the faultless force and
profound subtlety of this deep and cunning instinct for
the absolute expression of absolute natural beauty is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
doubtless the one main distinctive gift or power which
denotes him as a poet among all his equals.” We may
safely accept this verdict of poet upon poet as a true
one: yet I should be inclined to demur to such strong
adjectives as “faultless” and “absolute.” Beautiful as
several of them are, I might hesitate to say that even
one poem by Keats exhibits this his special characteristic
in a faultless degree, or expresses absolutely throughout
a natural beauty of absolute quality. To the last, he
appears to me to have been somewhat wanting in those
faculties of selection and of discipline which we sum up,
by a rough-and-ready process, in the word “taste.” He
had done a great deal in this direction, and would
probably, with a few years more of life, have done all
that was needed; but we have to take him as he stands,
with those few years denied. Unless perhaps in “La
Belle Dame sans Merci,” Keats has not, I think, come
nearer to perfection than in the “Ode to a Nightingale.”
It is with some trepidation that I recur to this Ode, for
the invidious purpose of testing its claim to be adjudged
“faultless,” for in so doing I shall certainly lose the
sympathy of some readers, and strain the patience of
many. The question, however, seems to be a very fair
one to raise, and the specimen a strong one to try it by,
and so I persevere. The first point of weakness&mdash;excess
which becomes weak in result&mdash;is a surfeit of mythological
allusions: Lethe, Dryad (the nightingale is turned into
a “light-wingèd Dryad of the trees”&mdash;which is as much
as to say, a light-wingèd <i>Oak</i>-nymph of the <i>trees</i>), Flora,
Hippocrene, Bacchus, the Queen-moon (the Queen-moon
appears at first sight to be the classical Phœbe,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
who is here “clustered around by all her starry Fays,”
spirits proper to a Northern mythology; but possibly
Keats thought more of a Faery-queen than of Phœbe).
Then comes the passage (already cited in these pages)
about the poet’s wish for a draught of wine, to help
him towards spiritual commune with the nightingale.
Some exquisite phrases in this passage have endeared it
to all readers of Keats; yet I cannot but regard it as
very foreign to the main subject-matter. Surely nobody
wants wine as a preparation for enjoying a nightingale’s
music, whether in a literal or in a fanciful relation.
Taken in detail, to call wine “the true, the blushful
Hippocrene”&mdash;the veritable fount of poetic inspiration&mdash;seems
both stilted and repulsive, and the phrase “with
beaded bubbles winking at the brim” is (though picturesque)
trivial, in the same way as much of Keats’s earlier
work. Far worse is the succeeding image, “Not charioted
by Bacchus and his pards”&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, not under the inspiration
of wine: the poet will fly to the nightingale, but not
in a leopard-drawn chariot. Further on, as if we had
not already had enough of wine and its associations, the
coming musk-rose is described as “full of dewy wine”&mdash;an
expression of very dubious appositeness: and the
like may be said of “become a sod,” in the sense of
“become a corpse&mdash;earth to earth.” The renowned
address&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Thou wast not born for death, immortal bird!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No hungry generations tread thee down,”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>seems almost outside the region of criticism. Still, it is
a <a name="Page_201t" id="Page_201t"></a><a href="#Page_201tn">palpable</a> fact that this address, according to its place in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
the context, is a logical solecism. While “Youth grows
pale and spectre-thin and dies,” while the poet would
“become a sod" to the requiem sung by the nightingale,
the nightingale itself is pronounced immortal. But this
antithesis cannot stand the test of a moment’s reflection.
Man, as a race, is as deathless, as superior to the tramp
of hungry generations, as is the nightingale as a race:
while the nightingale as an individual bird has a life not
less fleeting, still more fleeting, than a man as an
individual. We have now arrived at the last stanza of
the ode. Here the term “deceiving elf,” applied to “the
fancy,” sounds rather petty, and in the nature of a make-rhyme:
but this may possibly be a prejudice.</p>

<p>Having thus&mdash;in the interest of my reader as a critical
appraiser of poetry&mdash;burned my fingers a little at the
clear and perennial flame of the “Ode to a Nightingale,”
I shall quit that superb composition, and the whole quintett
of odes, and shall proceed to other phases of my
subject. The “Ode to Indolence,” and the fragment of
an “Ode to Maia,” need not detain us; the former, however,
is important as indicating a mood of mind&mdash;too
vaguely open to the influences of the moment for either
love, ambition, or poesy&mdash;to which we may well suppose
that Keats was sufficiently prone. The few poems which
remain to be mentioned were all printed posthumously.</p>

<p>There are four addresses to Fanny Brawne, dating
perhaps from early till late in 1819; two of them are
irregular lyrics, and two sonnets. The best of the four
is the sonnet, “The day is gone, and all its sweets are
gone,” which counts indeed among the better sonnets of
Keats. Taken collectively, all four supply valuable evi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>dence
as to the poet’s love affair, confirmatory of what
appears in his letters; they exhibit him quelled by the
thought of his mistress and her charms, and jealous of
her mixing in or enjoying the company of others.</p>

<p>Keats wrote some half-hundred of sonnets altogether,
some of them among his very earliest and most trifling
performances, others up to his latest period, including
the last of all his compositions. Notwithstanding his
marked growth in love of form, and his ultimate surprising
power of expression&mdash;both being qualities peculiarly
germane to this form of verse&mdash;his sonnets appear
to me to be seldom masterly. A certain freakishness of
disposition, and liability to be led astray by some point
of detail into side-issues, mar the symmetry and concentration
of his work. Perhaps the sonnet on “Chapman’s
Homer,” early though it was, remains the best which he
produced; it is at any rate pre-eminent in singleness of
thought, illustrated by a definite and grand image. It
has a true opening and a true climax, and a clear link of
inventive association between the thing mentally signified
in chief, and the modes of its concrete presentment. In
points of this kind Keats is seldom equally happy in his
other sonnets; sometimes not happy at all, but distinctly
at fault. There is a second Homeric sonnet, “Standing
aloof in giant ignorance” (1818), which contains one line
which has been very highly praised,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“There is a budding morrow in midnight:”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>but, regarded as a whole, it is a weakling in comparison
with the Chapman sonnet. The sonnets, “To<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
Sleep” (“O soft embalmer of the still midnight”), “Why
did I laugh to-night?” and “On a Dream” (“As Hermes
once took to his feathers light”)&mdash;all of them dated in
1819&mdash;are remarkable; the third would indeed almost be
excellent were it not for the inadmissible laxity of an
alexandrine last line. This is the sonnet of which we
have already spoken, the dream of Paolo and Francesca.
The “Why did I laugh to-night?” is a strange personal
utterance, in which the poet (not yet attacked by his
mortal illness) exalts death above verse, fame, and beauty,
in the same mood of mind as in the lovely passage of
the “Ode to a Nightingale”; but the sonnet, considered
as an example of its own form of art, is too exclamatory
and uncombined.</p>

<p>There are several minor poems by Keats of which&mdash;though
some of them are extremely dear to his devotees&mdash;I
have made no mention. Such are “Teignmouth,”
“Where be you going, you Devon maid?” “Meg Merrilies,”
“Walking in Scotland,” “Staffa,” “Lines on the
Mermaid Tavern,” “Robin Hood,” “To Fancy,” “To
the Poets,” “In a drear-nighted December,” “Hush,
hush, tread softly,” four “Faery Songs.” Most of these
pieces seem to me over-rated. As a rule they have
lyrical impulse, along with the brightness or the tenderness
which the subject bespeaks; but they are slight in
significance and in structure, pleasurable but not memorable
work. One enjoys them once and again, and then
their office is over; they have not in them that stuff
which can be laid to heart, nor that spherical unity and
replenishment which can make of a mere snatch of verse
an inscription for the adamantine portal of time.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>The feeling with which Keats regarded women in real
life has been already spoken of. As to the tone of his
poems respecting them we have his own evidence. A
letter of his to Armitage Brown, dated towards the first
days of September 1820, says, in reference to the “Lamia”
volume: “One of the causes, I understand from different
quarters, of the unpopularity of this new book, is the
offence the ladies take at me. On thinking that matter
over, I am certain that I have said nothing in a spirit to
displease any woman I would care to please; but still
there is a tendency to class women in my books with
roses and sweetmeats; they never see themselves
dominant.” The long poems in the volume in question
were “Isabella,” “The Eve of St. Agnes,” “Hyperion,”
and “Lamia.” In “Hyperion” women are of course not
dominant; but, as regards the other three poems, they
are surely dominant enough in one sense. In “Isabella”
the heroine is the sole figure of prime importance&mdash;so
also in “Lamia”; and in the “Eve of St. Agnes” she
counts for much more than Porphyro, though the number
of stanzas about her may be fewer. Nevertheless it
might be that the women in the three poems, though
“dominant,” are “classed with roses and sweetmeats.”
I do not see, however, that this can fairly be said of
Madeline in the “Eve of St. Agnes”; she is made a very
charming and loveable figure, although she does nothing
very particular except to undress without looking behind
her, and to elope. Again, Isabella, amenable as she
may be to the censure of the severely virtuous, plays a
part which takes her very considerably out of affinity to
roses and sweetmeats. To Lamia the objection applies<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
clearly enough; but then she is not exactly a woman,
and Keats resents so fiercely the far from indefensible
line of conduct which Apollonius adopts in relation to
her that it seems hard if the ladies owed the poet a
grudge. On the whole I incline to think that they must
have been misreported; but the statement in Keats’s
letter remains not the less significant as a symptom of
his real underlying feeling about women.</p>

<p>It has often been pointed out that Keats’s lovers have
a habit of “swooning,” and the fact has sometimes been
remarked upon as evidencing a certain want of virility in
himself. I cannot affect to be, so far, of a different
opinion. The incident and the phrase do manifestly
tend to the namby-pamby. This may have been more a
matter of affected or self-willed diction on his part&mdash;and
diction of that kind appears constantly in his earlier
poems, and not seldom in his later ones&mdash;than of actual
character chargeable against himself; yet I would not
entirely disregard it in the latter relation either. Keats
was a very young man, with a limited experience of life.
He had to picture to himself how his lovers would be
likely to behave under given conditions; and, if he thought
they would be likely to swoon, the probability is that he
also, under parallel conditions, would have been likely
to swoon&mdash;or at least supposed he would be likely.
Because he thrashed a butcher-boy, or was indignant at
backbiting and meanness, we are not to credit him with
an unmingled fund of that toughness which distinguishes
the English middle class. The English middle-class man
is not habitually addicted to writing an “Endymion,” an
“Eve of St. Agnes,” or an “Ode on Melancholy.”<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>Sensuousness has been frequently defined as the paramount
bias of Keats’s poetic genius. This is, in large
measure, unassailably true. He was a man of perception
rather than of contemplation or speculation. Perception
has to do with perceptible things; perceptible
things must be objects of sense, and the mind which
dwells on objects of sense must <i>ipso facto</i> be a mind of
the sensuous order. But the mind which is mainly
sensuous by direct action may also work by reflex action,
and pass from sensuousness into sentiment. It cannot
fairly be denied that Keats’s mind continually did this;
it had direct action potently, and reflex action amply.
He saw so far and so keenly into the sensuous as to be
penetrated with the sentiment which, to a healthy and
large nature, is its inseparable outcome. We might say
that, if the sensuous was his atmosphere, the breathing
apparatus with which he respired it was sentiment. In
his best work&mdash;for instance, in all the great odes&mdash;the
two things are so intimately combined that the reader
can only savour the sensuous nucleus through the sentiment,
its medium or vehicle. One of the most compendious
and elegant phrases in which the genius of Keats
has been defined is that of Leigh Hunt: “He never
beheld an oak tree without seeing the Dryad.” In immediate
meaning Hunt glances here at the mythical sympathy
or personifying imagination of the poet; but, if we accept
the phrase as applying to the sensuous object-painting,
along with its ideal aroma or suggestion in his finest
work, we shall still find it full of right significance. We
need not dwell upon other less mature performances in
which the two things are less closely interfused. Cer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>tainly
some of his work is merely, and some even crudely,
sensuous: but this is work in which the poet was trying
his materials and his powers, and rising towards mastery
of his real faculty and ultimate function.</p>

<p>While discriminating between what was excellent in
Keats, and what was not excellent, or was merely tentative
in the direction of final excellence, we must not
confuse endowments, or the homage which is due to
endowments, of a radically different order. Many
readers, and there have been among them several men
highly qualified to pronounce, have set Keats beside his
great contemporary Shelley, and indeed above him. I
cannot do this. To me it seems that the primary gift of
Shelley, the spirit in which he exercised it, the objects
upon which he exercised it, the detail and the sum of his
achievement, the actual produce in appraisable work
done, the influence and energy of the work in the future,
were all superior to those of Keats, and even superior
beyond any reasonable terms of comparison. If Shelley’s
poems had defects&mdash;which they indisputably had&mdash;Keats’s
poems also had defects. After all that can be said in
their praise&mdash;and this should be said in the most generous
or rather grateful and thankful spirit&mdash;it seems to
me true that not many of Keats’s poems are highly
admirable; that most of them, amid all their beauty, have
an adolescent and frequently a morbid tone, marking
want of manful thew and sinew and of mental balance;
that he is not seldom obscure, chiefly through indifference
to the thought itself and its necessary means of
development; that he is emotional without substance,
and beautiful without control; and that personalism of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
wilful and fitful kind pervades the mass of his handiwork.
We have already seen, however, that there is a certain
not inconsiderable proportion of his poems to which
these exceptions do not apply, or apply only with greatly
diminished force; and, as a last expression of our large
and abiding debt to him and to his well-loved memory,
we recur to his own words, and say that he has given us
many a “thing of beauty,” which will remain “a joy for
ever.” By his early death he was doomed to be the poet
of youthfulness; by being the poet of youthfulness he
was privileged to become and to remain enduringly the
poet of rapt expectation and passionate delight.</p>

<div class="footnotes"><h3>FOOTNOTES:</h3>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> A small point here may deserve a note. A letter from John
Keats to his brother George, under date of September 21st, 1819,
contains the following words: “Our bodies, every seven years, are
completely fresh-materialed: seven years ago it was not this hand
that clenched itself against Hammond.” Another version of the
same letter (the true wording of which is matter of some dispute)
substitutes: “Mine is not the same hand I clenched at Hammond’s.”
Mr. Buxton Forman, who gives the former phrase as the genuine
one, thinks that “this phrase points to a serious rupture as the cause
of his quitting his apprenticeship to Hammond.” My own inclination
is to surmise that the accurate reading may be&mdash;“It was not
this hand that clenched itself against Hammond’s”; indicating, not
any quarrel, but the friendly habitual clasp of hand against hand.
“Seven years ago” would reach back to September 1812: whereas
Keats did not part from Hammond until 1814.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> This is Hunt’s own express statement. It has been disputed,
but I am not prepared to reject it.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> Biographers have been reticent on this subject. Keats’s statement
however speaks for itself, and a high medical authority, Dr.
Richardson, writing in <i>The Asclepiad</i> for April 1884, and reviewing
the whole subject of the poet’s constitutional and other ailments,
says that Keats in Oxford “runs loose, and pays a forfeit for his
indiscretion which ever afterwards physically and morally embarrasses
him.” He pronounces that Keats’s early death was “expedited,
perhaps excited, by his own imprudence,” but was substantially due
to hereditary disease. His mother, as we have already seen, had
died of the malady which killed the poet, consumption. It is not
clear to me what Keats meant by saying that “from his <i>employment</i>”
his health would be insecure. One might suppose that he was
thinking of the long and haphazard working hours of a young
surgeon or medical man; in which case, this seems to be the latest
instance in which he spoke of himself as still belonging to that
profession.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> Hitherto printed “life”; it seems to me clear that “lips” is the
right word.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_5_5" id="Footnote_5_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> In Medwin’s “Life of Shelley,” vol. ii. pp. 89 to 92, are some
interesting remarks upon Keats’s character and demeanour, written
in a warm and sympathetic tone. Some of them were certainly
penned by Miss Brawne (Mrs. Lindon), and possibly all of them.
Mr. Colvin (p. 233 of his book) has called special attention to these
remarks: I forbear from quoting them. A leading point is to
vindicate Keats from the imputation of “violence of temper.”</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_6_6" id="Footnote_6_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> This passage is taken from Lord Houghton’s “Life, &amp;c., of
Keats,” first published in 1848, and by “home” he certainly means
Wentworth Place, Hampstead. Yet in his Aldine Edition of
Keats, his lordship says that the poet “was at that time, very much
against Mr. Brown’s desire and advice, living alone in London.”
This latter statement may possibly be correct&mdash;I question it. The
passage, as written by Lord Houghton, is condensed from the
narrative of Brown. The latter is given verbatim in Mr. Colvin’s
“Keats,” and is, of course, the more important and interesting
of the two. I abstain from quoting it, solely out of regard to
Mr. Colvin’s rights of priority.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_7_7" id="Footnote_7_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> Apparently Miss Brawne had remonstrated against the imputation
of “flirting with Brown,” and much else to like effect in a
recent letter from Keats.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_8_8" id="Footnote_8_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8_8"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> I observe this name occurring once elsewhere in relation to
Keats, but am not clear whose house it represents.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_9_9" id="Footnote_9_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9_9"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> It has been suggested (by Dante Gabriel Rossetti, as printed in
Mr. Forman’s edition of Keats) that the poem here referred to is
“The Eve of St. Mark.” Keats had begun it fully a year and a
half before the date of this letter, but, not having continued it, he
might have spoken of “having it in his head.”</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_10_10" id="Footnote_10_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10_10"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> This may require a word of explanation. Keats, detained at
Portsmouth by stress of weather, had landed for a day, and seen his
friend Mr. Snook, at Bedhampton. Brown was then in Chichester,
only ten miles off, but of this Keats had not at the time been aware.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_11_11" id="Footnote_11_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11_11"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> The &mdash; before “you” appears in the letter, as printed in Mr.
Forman’s edition of Keats. It might seem that Keats hesitated a
moment whether to write “you” or “Miss Brawne.”</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_12_12" id="Footnote_12_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12_12"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> No such letter is known. It has been stated that Keats, after
leaving home, could never summon up resolution enough to write to
Miss Brawne: possibly this statement ought to be limited to the
time after he had reached Italy.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_13_13" id="Footnote_13_13"></a><a href="#FNanchor_13_13"><span class="label">[13]</span></a> Lord Houghton says that Keats in Naples “could not bear to
go to the opera, on account of the sentinels who stood constantly
on the stage:” he spoke of “the continual visible tyranny of this
government,” and said “I will not leave even my bones in the
midst of this despotism.” Sentinels on the stage have, I believe,
been common in various parts of the continent, as a mere matter of
government parade, or of routine for preserving public order. The
other points (for which no authority is cited by Lord Houghton)
must, I think, be over-stated. In November 1820 the short-lived
constitution of the kingdom of Naples was in full operation, and
neither tyranny nor despotism was in the ascendant&mdash;rather a certain
degree of popular license.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_14_14" id="Footnote_14_14"></a><a href="#FNanchor_14_14"><span class="label">[14]</span></a> The reader of Keats’s preface will note that this is a misrepresentation.
Keats did not speak of any fierce hell of criticism, nor
did he ask to remain uncriticized in order that he might write
more. What he said was that a feeling critic would not fall foul of
him for hoping to write good poetry in the long run, and would be
aware that Keats’s own sense of failure in “Endymion” was as
fierce a hell as he could be chastised by.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_15_15" id="Footnote_15_15"></a><a href="#FNanchor_15_15"><span class="label">[15]</span></a> This phrase stands printed with inverted commas, as a quotation.
It is not, however, a quotation from the letter of J. S.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_16_16" id="Footnote_16_16"></a><a href="#FNanchor_16_16"><span class="label">[16]</span></a> “Coolness” (which seems to be the right word) in the letter to
Miss Mitford.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_17_17" id="Footnote_17_17"></a><a href="#FNanchor_17_17"><span class="label">[17]</span></a> Severn’s view of the matter some years afterwards has however
received record in the diary of Henry Crabb Robinson. Under the
date May 6, 1837, we read&mdash;“He [Severn] denies that Keats’s
death was hastened by the article in the <i>Quarterly</i>.”</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_18_18" id="Footnote_18_18"></a><a href="#FNanchor_18_18"><span class="label">[18]</span></a> The passage which begins&mdash;
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">“Hard by<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stood serene Cupids watching silently”<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
has some affinity with a passage in Shelley’s “Adonais.” The
latter passage is, however, more directly based upon one in the
Idyll of Bion on Adonis.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_19_19" id="Footnote_19_19"></a><a href="#FNanchor_19_19"><span class="label">[19]</span></a> I do not clearly understand from the poem whether Endymion
does or does not know, until the story nears its conclusion, that the
goddess who favours him is Diana. He appears at any rate to
<i>guess</i> as much, either during this present interview or shortly afterwards.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_20_20" id="Footnote_20_20"></a><a href="#FNanchor_20_20"><span class="label">[20]</span></a> Keats has been laughed at for ignorance in printing “Visit my
Cytherea”; but it appears on good evidence that what he really
wrote was “Visit thou my Cythera.” A false quantity in this same
canto, “Nèptŭnus,” cannot be explained away.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_21_21" id="Footnote_21_21"></a><a href="#FNanchor_21_21"><span class="label">[21]</span></a> Declared it in some very odd lines; for instance&mdash;
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Do gently murder half my soul, and I<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall feel the other half so utterly!”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_22_22" id="Footnote_22_22"></a><a href="#FNanchor_22_22"><span class="label">[22]</span></a> See <a href="#Page_52">p. 52</a> as to Miss Brawne.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_23_23" id="Footnote_23_23"></a><a href="#FNanchor_23_23"><span class="label">[23]</span></a> I presume the “three masterpieces” are “The Eve of St.
Agnes,” “Hyperion,” and “Lamia”; this leaves out of count the
short “Belle Dame sans Merci,” and the unfinished “Eve of St.
Mark,” but certainly not because Dante Rossetti rated those lower
than the three others.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_24_24" id="Footnote_24_24"></a><a href="#FNanchor_24_24"><span class="label">[24]</span></a> There are some various readings in this poem (as here,
“wretched wight”); I adopt the phrases which I prefer.</p></div>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
